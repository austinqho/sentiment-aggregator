1ivnr42,I'm a Product Designer who built a Price Comparison platform frontend in 32 hours with Cursor+Claude,"# Introduction

Hey everyone! 👋 I’ve been working on a **comprehensive shopping experienc**e in the form of a **price comparison** platform called [PricePilot](https://trypricepilot.com/)**.**

**It's been designed** to help shoppers discover products efficiently, compare product information side-by-side, and then help compare prices across multiple retailers. As a solo founder, I wanted to share my journey, the challenges I faced, and the tech stack I used.

***BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER:*** *To be transparent as my post is catching the ire of some users, the total time spent on the frontend is at about* ***\~80hrs or so***. The 32 hours I had added in the post title was seeing how fast I could go live with a basic ecommerce frontend which included a search experience, product listings and details page, and full responsiveness.

# Pain Points That Led to PricePilot

Shopping online should be simple, but:

* Finding the best price often means opening multiple tabs and checking different retailers manually.
* Many comparison sites feel outdated, cluttered, or don’t include key product details and features.
* Many platforms prioritize affiliate revenue over a clean UX

I wanted to build something better—**fast, user-friendly, and helpful.**

# How PricePilot Solves These Issues

✅ **Clear, simple UI** and **lightning-fast search** designed for usability  
✅ **Side-by-side product information comparisons** to help you easily compare the differences in price, ratings, and specifications  
✅ **Side-by-side price comparisons** across multiple retailers so you don't have to find the product on each site

*Note: For the moment, we only show US retailers but plan to expand to Canada and perhaps elsewhere once we get everything figured out for the US audience.*

# Tech Stack

💻 **Frontend**: Vercel + Next.js + Typescript + Tailwind CSS + Typesense (Search)  
🛠 **Backend:** Supabase, Python+Playwright+BS4 for web scraping, Node for getting info from APIs and product feeds

# Would Love Your Thoughts!

I’m actively working on improving **search, filtering, and UX optimizations**. Additionally working on getting many more products for you to shop for. If you’re interested in price comparison tools, I’d love your feedback! 🙌

1j4prw6,My (Hopeful) Cursor Redemption Arc.,"This past week, I posted on this subreddit about a silly problem that didn’t really need to be fixed—but I’m glad I did. Turns out the custom cursor trail I spent hours fiddling with, which I thought was the coolest thing about my website, actually sucked. And boy, did you guys not hold back. But I’m so glad I got grilled on my terrible cursor—it was distracting and overall just not great.

I decided to channel this energy into creating something new. So, I completely scrapped the old code and started from scratch. I created two new iterations, trying to incorporate as much of everyone's feedback as possible.

From this link, you’ll find three videos: one of my original cursor effect, one that’s a bit Stronger with the Ink, little darker and more rugged, and another that’s watercolor-inspired with some nice light diffusion. It would mean the world to me if, once again, you all were kind enough to lay into me and tell me what sucks. I tried to take in all the feedback I received, and any pointers would also be amazing!

I still remember the [first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/f47r2e/showoff_saturday_brother_and_i_just_finished/) posting about our project in this community five years ago. We didn't really know what we were doing (still easily applies today) and were getting bashed from left and right, but the feedback we got here was super useful and kept us going.

[Wasp](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) is a full-stack, batteries-included web framework built on top of React, Node.js, and Prisma. It just crossed 15,000 stars [on GitHub](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) and is being used by solopreneurs, startups, and Fortune 500 companies. There are about 4,000 builders in our Discord, and Wasp is currently in Beta.

Here's the story of how we got here and what we learned.

# The beginning - ""What you're building is a holy grail. Everyone before you failed.""

This is what YC told us when we applied for the second time in May 2020. At that point, we had worked on Wasp for 1.5 years, the last nine months full-time. We had quit our previous jobs and gone all in. By this point, we were already fairly drained mentally, physically, and financially. Still, the curiosity of whether we can make this happen was stronger than fear and we decided to give it one last shot.

Today, **Wasp has over 15,000 stars on GitHub**. Developers of all backgrounds have used it to **develop thousands of web apps**, from side projects that have grown into [acquired](https://wasp.sh/blog/2024/09/17/from-idea-to-20k-in-days-how-wasp-accelerated-nuloapps-launch) or [revenue-generating businesses](https://docs.opensaas.sh/blog/2024-12-10-turboreel-os-ai-video-generator-built-with-open-saas/) to venture-backed startups and internal tools deployed within Fortune 500 companies.

Some people have grown to love Wasp and the vision it pursues. Thanks to them, we enjoy working on it. Without the community that gathered around Wasp (>4,000 devs in our Discord), we wouldn’t have been even close to where we are today.

# The journey - getting from 0 to 15,000 stars

As with most success stories, the success rarely happens linearly. It usually starts with a long period of ""drought"" with occasional signs of life, and then there is a moment when things click together and start moving really fast. We experienced the same, and it looked something like this:

https://preview.redd.it/32yz0cwkovoe1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9214b159795869ac406048bf43c944c5ce028c4

# The inception - “Why not?”

In the beginning, Wasp was just an idea—or rather, a question: ""*Why hasn't anyone built this yet? What would we discover if we tried?*"" After spending a decade building web apps and using every major tech stack (from PHP to Java and Node.js on the server to Backbone, Angular, and React on the client), we were feeling the pain of ""framework fatigue,"" aka reinventing the wheel with each new stack.

So we set out to start thinking about it and put things on paper (ok, Google Slides). This is how the original idea for Wasp was born - ***can we create a framework that removes a lot of boilerplate by offering higher-level abstractions, but is still flexible enough and is not strictly bound to the specific stack and architecture?***

Now looking at it, it really does sound like a holy grail.

# Getting in YC and things getting real

About nine months in, full-time, we started getting some early traction and received positive feedback from Reddit, Hacker News, and Product Hunt, but we also started realizing how much work is needed to bring a full-stack web framework to a state where it’s usable, especially with the ambitious requirements we set for ourselves.

https://preview.redd.it/r2rn8r04pvoe1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3f992550743a9652bd5c30bf871976a9210767d

Finally, we got into YC the third time we applied for it. They were following our progress for the last year and, having seen the community excitement, decided to take a bet on our crazy idea.

# Beta and beyond - MAGE and OpenSaaS

Looking at the graph, you can spot two key inflection points. The first one happened in July 2023 when we launched [**MAGE**](https://wasp.sh/blog/2023/07/10/gpt-web-app-generator), a GPT SaaS starter that uses Wasp under the hood (you can think of it as one-shot Loveable/Bolt). It was among the first LLM products that could generate a working full-stack web app, bringing many eyes to Wasp.

https://preview.redd.it/r2czohz9pvoe1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dfdfe19b3c0917263d86235504edc183a576574

The second major growth catalyzer came in December 2023 with the launch of [**OpenSaaS**](https://opensaas.sh/), our open-source SaaS starter built on top of Wasp, which now has almost 10,000 stars on GitHub.

We realized that most builders really want to start working on their idea as quickly as possible without picking out and patching together all the different features every SaaS needs - authentication, payments, admin dashboard, sending emails, blog, …

And this is exactly what we provided - **a 100% free & open-source, high-quality, SaaS starter based on React, Node.js, Prisma, and Wasp**. OpenSaaS basically became a “killer app” for Wasp as it attracts developers to try it and realize how helpful the framework is.

[Open SaaS also pairs extremely well with Cursor](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1832194642596508076) \- given Wasp’s robust structure and higher-level primitives, many developers have found it as an ideal combo for getting their SaaS-es from an idea to a production-ready app in a matter of days.

# Language/DSL vs framework - so which one is it?

https://preview.redd.it/kpl3gr31qvoe1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=a74d1c6f3ced173101537305e5f45bf2d96f2edc

As you can see from the examples above, we used to refer to Wasp as a language, DSL - a Domain Specific Language. It was for these reasons that we originally set out to have an abstraction layer that can, in the future, work with any language, library, and architecture.

For this, we needed to introduce our own compiler that would first analyze your app’s specification that you defined via Wasp (e.g., your routes, async jobs, db operations, …), combine it with the “native” code you wrote in React & Node.js, and finally generate a React/Node.js app. That effectively meant we’ve invented our own language, albeit very limited and simple.

**This is how we initially presented Wasp, but we learned that is the wrong way to think about it. Wasp is by its function a web framework, just like Laravel, Rails, or Next.js**. The fact that it uses a compiler under the hood is simply an implementation detail that gives it its superpowers. For example, thanks to this approach, [**we can easily visualize the topology of your whole app**](https://wasp.sh/blog/2024/04/25/first-framework-that-lets-you-visualize-react-node-app-code)**, from database to server and client components**:

https://preview.redd.it/ggjv1bo3qvoe1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=87b8ec16f90c0c93dae544308bd824f735dec137

This still a bit of a party trick now, but it opens space for some interesting tooling features in the future.

# The road to 1.0 and building ""Laravel/Rails for JS""

This is the story of how Wasp came to be where it is today. For more details on the very early days (getting from an idea to the first 1,000 stars), you can check out [this post](https://wasp.sh/blog/2022/09/29/journey-to-1000-gh-stars).

What’s next? After almost five years of building and getting feedback from you, we have a pretty clear picture of what Wasp 1.0 needs to look like and we'll just go for it. Our goal is to do what Laravel did for PHP and Rails did for Ruby - an opinionated full-stack, batteries-included framework which you can deploy anywhere and which also scales as you grow. Obviously, the requirements and expectations for frameworks have changed a lot since Laravel/Rails/Django beginnings, but that kind of productivity and the overall experience is what we're after.

What would we discover if we tried?*"" After spending a decade building web apps and using every major tech stack (from PHP to Java and Node.js on the server to Backbone, Angular, and React on the client), we were feeling the pain of ""framework fatigue,"" aka reinventing the wheel with each new stack.

So we set out to start thinking about it and put things on paper (ok, Google Slides). This is how the original idea for Wasp was born - ***can we create a framework that removes a lot of boilerplate by offering higher-level abstractions, but is still flexible enough and is not strictly bound to the specific stack and architecture?***

Now looking at it, it really does sound like a holy grail.

# Getting in YC and things getting real

About nine months in, full-time, we started getting some early traction and received positive feedback from Reddit, Hacker News, and Product Hunt, but we also started realizing how much work is needed to bring a full-stack web framework to a state where it’s usable, especially with the ambitious requirements we set for ourselves.

Finally, we got into YC the third time we applied for it. They were following our progress for the last year and, having seen the community excitement, decided to take a bet on our crazy idea.

# Beta and beyond - MAGE and OpenSaaS

Looking at the graph, you can spot two key inflection points. The first one happened in July 2023 when we launched [**MAGE**](https://wasp.sh/blog/2023/07/10/gpt-web-app-generator), a GPT SaaS starter that uses Wasp under the hood (you can think of it as one-shot Loveable/Bolt). It was among the first LLM products that could generate a working full-stack web app, bringing many eyes to Wasp.

The second major growth catalyzer came in December 2023 with the launch of [**OpenSaaS**](https://opensaas.sh/), our open-source SaaS starter built on top of Wasp, which now has almost 10,000 stars on GitHub.

We realized that most builders really want to start working on their idea as quickly as possible without picking out and patching together all the different features every SaaS needs - authentication, payments, admin dashboard, sending emails, blog, …

And this is exactly what we provided - **a 100% free & open-source, high-quality, SaaS starter based on React, Node.js, Prisma, and Wasp**. OpenSaaS basically became a “killer app” for Wasp as it attracts developers to try it and realize how helpful the framework is.

[Open SaaS also pairs extremely well with Cursor](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1832194642596508076) \- given Wasp’s robust structure and higher-level primitives, many developers have found it as an ideal combo for getting their SaaS-es from an idea to a production-ready app in a matter of days.

# Language/DSL vs framework - so which one is it?

https://preview.redd.it/kpl3gr31qvoe1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=a74d1c6f3ced173101537305e5f45bf2d96f2edc

As you can see from the examples above, we used to refer to Wasp as a language, DSL - a Domain Specific Language. It was for these reasons that we originally set out to have an abstraction layer that can, in the future, work with any language, library, and architecture.

For this, we needed to introduce our own compiler that would first analyze your app’s specification that you defined via Wasp (e.g., your routes, async jobs, db operations, …), combine it with the “native” code you wrote in React & Node.js, and finally generate a React/Node.js app. That effectively meant we’ve invented our own language, albeit very limited and simple.

**This is how we initially presented Wasp, but we learned that is the wrong way to think about it. Wasp is by its function a web framework, just like Laravel, Rails, or Next.js**. The fact that it uses a compiler under the hood is simply an implementation detail that gives it its superpowers. For example, thanks to this approach, [**we can easily visualize the topology of your whole app**](https://wasp.sh/blog/2024/04/25/first-framework-that-lets-you-visualize-react-node-app-code)**, from database to server and client components**:

This still a bit of a party trick now, but it opens space for some interesting tooling features in the future.

# The road to 1.0 and building ""Laravel/Rails for JS""

This is the story of how Wasp came to be where it is today. For more details on the very early days (getting from an idea to the first 1,000 stars), you can check out [this post](https://wasp.sh/blog/2022/09/29/journey-to-1000-gh-stars).

What’s next? After almost five years of building and getting feedback from you, we have a pretty clear picture of what Wasp 1.0 needs to look like and we'll just go for it. Our goal is to do what Laravel did for PHP and Rails did for Ruby - an opinionated full-stack, batteries-included framework which you can deploy anywhere and which also scales as you grow. Obviously, the requirements and expectations for frameworks have changed a lot since Laravel/Rails/Django beginnings, but that kind of productivity and the overall experience is what we're after.

r/webdev, thanks again.","My brother and I built Laravel for JS and it just crossed 15,000 stars on GH. Heres the backstory. Hey webdev, I still remember the first time posting about our project in this community five years ago. We didnt really know what we were doing still easily applies today and were getting bashed from left and right, but the feedback we got here was super useful and kept us going. Wasp is a fullstack, batteriesincluded web framework built on top of React, Node.js, and Prisma. It just crossed 15,000 stars on GitHub and is being used by solopreneurs, startups, and Fortune 500 companies. There are about 4,000 builders in our Discord, and Wasp is currently in Beta. Heres the story of how we got here and what we learned. The beginning What youre building is a holy grail. Everyone before you failed. This is what YC told us when we applied for the second time in May 2020. At that point, we had worked on Wasp for 1.5 years, the last nine months fulltime. We had quit our previous jobs and gone all in. By this point, we were already fairly drained mentally, physically, and financially. Still, the curiosity of whether we can make this happen was stronger than fear and we decided to give it one last shot. Today, Wasp has over 15,000 stars on GitHub. Developers of all backgrounds have used it to develop thousands of web apps, from side projects that have grown into acquired or revenuegenerating businesses to venturebacked startups and internal tools deployed within Fortune 500 companies. SaaSes made with Wasp OpenSaaS Some people have grown to love Wasp and the vision it pursues. Thanks to them, we enjoy working on it. Without the community that gathered around Wasp 4,000 devs in our Discord, we wouldnt have been even close to where we are today. Folks saying nice stuff about Wasp theres opposite, too The journey getting from 0 to 15,000 stars As with most success stories, the success rarely happens linearly. It usually starts with a long period of drought with occasional signs of life, and then there is a moment when things click together and start moving really fast. We experienced the same, and it looked something like this The inception Why not? In the beginning, Wasp was just an ideaor rather, a question Why hasnt anyone built this yet?

1jbt8sw,Why Are Developers So Resistant to AI?,"I don’t get it. Yesterday, I watched an interview with the Anthropic CEO saying that in the next 12 months, 90% of code will be written by AI. At the same time, Mark Zuckerberg was on Joe Rogan’s podcast, saying Meta will have its first AI software engineer by 2025. And Google has already said 25% of its codebase is AI-generated.

Basically, every big tech leader—Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, all of them—are talking about how AI will completely change software development. And the first real, practical application we’re seeing is AI writing code. It’s already happening with tools like Cursor. If we just look at the rate of improvement, it’s hard to deny that if not in 12 months, then in 2-3 years, most code will be written by AI.

Yet, developers still seem super resistant to this idea. I get that AI won’t replace 100% of coding. We’ll still need engineers to solve problems. But it’s obvious that the number of devs needed per company is going to shrink. If a company has 150 devs today, maybe in a few years, they’ll need only 50 or less.

And this isn’t even coming out of nowhere. We’ve already seen mass layoffs post-Covid. The demand for developers isn’t skyrocketing like before, but the supply is still huge. So why are so many developers acting like AI isn’t a real threat to their jobs? Are they in denial? Or is there something I’m missing?

I certainly love that AI is getting popular. When you'll be creating an app that's 75% of the way there but the last 25% doesn't work no matter what you do and is super buggy, it'll be a goldmine for the devs who actually know their stuff.

If every 5 years number of devs double, and most juniors rely on AI, in just 10 years we'll have so many mediocre devs who are dependent on AI and aren't different from product manager ( but product managers have MBAs and experience)

However, in the last week or so I've attempted to build an app by using Cursor AI and other AI tools.  But I'm beginning to hit a roadblock with connecting databases/the back end to the front end. 

First question: what's the best way for me to learn how to approach these issues?  Which AI tool is best to guide me through these barriers?

Second question: if I am unable to complete this myself, what's the best way to source efficient work for a web app?  this would be a B2B web app in a focused industry primarily targeting sales and customer facing professionals.

1jf0pah,Tech stack recommendations for web app?,"Hi all, I've been using a self-hosted instance of Ghost CMS for the past year or so for my business. It's done very well but I think the business is at a point where we need to move beyond Ghost since we're sort of stretching it's functionality and using it in hacky ways that it's not built for.

I would like to build a web app that has similar functionality (Stripe subscriptions, gated content/user auth, and CMS functionality). We're going to be embedding lots of data visualizations and eventually we would like these visualizations to be interactive.

I am not a developer but have been using AI tools (Cursor, GPT, Claude) while customizing Ghost. 

I was thinking some combination of Next.js, Vercel/v0, Payload CMS, Supabase, and Stripe might make sense but not sure if this is too code-heavy for a non-dev like myself.

## Things to considerate:
1. Both the index.html and store.html links only script.js

2. opening the store.html and refreshing it 2-3 times gives this console error:
```txt
Error: Error fetching data: 
TypeError {}
message: ""Failed to fetch""
stack: ""TypeError: Failed to fetch↵ at window.fetch (http://localhost:8158/mguxb9xw_console.js:8:221620)↵ at fetchData (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:13:28)↵ at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:21:9)↵ at http://localhost:8158/script.js:4:1""
get stack: ƒ ()
set stack: ƒ ()
[[Prototype]]: Object
```
3. Open store.html and adding items in store.html and when I refresh the page 2-3 times it gives this error: and I cant add any items after that
```txt
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')

at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
at renderCartItems (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:47:16)
at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:22:3)
```
4. Clearing the localStorage and trying does not solve any problem

5. I threw both my code and errors at AI tools for help, but instead of fixing the bug, we both ended up more confused—now it feels like the AI is debugging me!

",2025-03-06 07:39:20,0,5,0.38,webdev,koko-hranghlu,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1j4ujan/i_have_problems_working_with_asyncawait_and_local/,"I have problems working with async/await and local json file. I have been debugging and smashing my head on table for the past 24 hours! ## My folder structure:
```txt

## Things to considerate:
1. Both the index.html and store.html links only script.js

2. opening the store.html and refreshing it 2-3 times gives this console error:
```txt
Error: Error fetching data: 
TypeError {}
message: ""Failed to fetch""
stack: ""TypeError: Failed to fetch↵ at window.fetch (http://localhost:8158/mguxb9xw_console.js:8:221620)↵ at fetchData (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:13:28)↵ at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:21:9)↵ at http://localhost:8158/script.js:4:1""
get stack: ƒ ()
set stack: ƒ ()
[[Prototype]]: Object
```
3. Open store.html and adding items in store.html and when I refresh the page 2-3 times it gives this error: and I cant add any items after that
```txt
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
at http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:55:25
at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
at renderCartItems (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:47:16)
at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:22:3)
```
4. Clearing the localStorage and trying does not solve any problem

5. I threw both my code and errors at AI tools for help, but instead of fixing the bug, we both ended up more confused—now it feels like the AI is debugging me!

1j6d84j,Best AI for Programming (2025-03),"Hey all, I've been using free-tier AI tools pretty intensively over the past few months to support my work and daily life. About 70% of my usage is for programming, and the rest is for other stuff. I’ve been jumping between tools like ChatGPT, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Deepseek—mostly because one of them is usually down or hits its limit when I need it.

Recently, I discovered Lovable dev (along with similar options like Bolt and v0) and gave it a try—pretty impressive stuff 😅. Now I'm feeling a bit stuck on which one is really worth upgrading to a paid subscription.

Any thoughts or suggestions? Also, if anyone’s got a setup that mixes two or more free AIs or even self-hosting options (whether on your own hardware or a rented server), I'm all ears.

1itinty,Loading screen question,"I got a working loading that is almost to my personal favorite. I just need to change the cursor color to gold. And the ring colors around. But I was wondering what should I do about the amount of times it shows up.

I currently have it so that it loads every time a user goes to the homepage. It's great. And I want to add a purposeful delay. Like make the screen 3 seconds long for the whole thing to work. And since the ring is already pulsing, make the text under it do the same.

But I was wondering if I should only have it once when someone goes into the website for the first time or should I just keep it so ita will always show up whenever a user goes to the homepage from any tab in my website?

Addition: I am just making a portfolio/personal website. I'm making this becuase there a few elements in the script takes maybe a second or two. I am adjusting the loading to be quick. And I have a fading animation for when the loading is done.

1j56ju8,I Built a Footnotes Plugin for Summernote – Looking for Feedback!,"Hey r/webdev,

I recently built and published a **Footnotes plugin** for the **Summernote WYSIWYG editor**, and I’d love to get your thoughts on it! 🎉

🔹 **What It Does:**

* Lets you insert **footnotes** at the cursor position.
* Automatically adds them to the end of the editor’s content.

🔹 **Why I Built It:**  
I noticed that Summernote doesn’t have a built-in footnotes feature, and manually handling footnotes can be frustrating, especially for blogs, academic content, or articles. So, I decided to create a plugin to solve this problem.

🔹 **Check it out here:**  
👉 **GitHub:** [https://github.com/ahmadyousefdev/summernote-footnotes](https://github.com/ahmadyousefdev/summernote-footnotes)

I’d really appreciate any **feedback, feature suggestions, or bug reports**! Let me know if this is something you’d use or if you have ideas for improvement. 🚀

1j0bvk2,AI Code Assistant Demos,"I think tools like Cursor and Copilot are nice. They haven’t been useful or reliable enough to revolutionize my workflow, but they certainly keep me from bouncing around Stack Overflow.

I saw a post by someone who works at a VP level raving over a demo where someone cloned an app using some AI tool. He then trash talked the “old school” way of building software with scrum teams and dozens of devs.

It was very disappointing, and alarming to see a post like that, because I feel he should know better.

1j9196v,"I didn't want to go, but PyCharm finally drove me into the arms of VSCode, after 5+ years.","I just switched to VSCode after well over five years with PyCharm. I didn't want to do it, but I just can't stand it anymore.

**Things I love about PyCharm and will miss**

1. The refactoring functionality. VSCode's Python extension has that too, but it isn't as nice. 

At this point, that's pretty much it.

**Things that drove me nuts**

1. IdeaVim. It actually got better recently, but for years and years, the undo function was busted, so you had to hit `u` over and over to undo what in real vim is a single operation. VSCode's neovim plugin uses actual neovim under the hood, which is obviously so much more robust and faithful, while IdeaVim will never be a full implementation.
2. The gradual accumulation of simple bugs that never get fixed.
3. It's so slow. I didn't appreciate just how slow until I switched over to VSCode. I mean, holy crap, it's 10x faster for a lot of things (opening a project, installing or restarting extensions, for example).

Here are the bugs that have bugged me the worst:

The ""usages"" window (cmd-click on a definition, see where it's used) constantly resizes itself too small. It's been a problem for years. They won't fix the way autosize works, OR let us turn it off. Plus you have to get your mouse cursor nearly pixel-perfect to resize it yourself, so you can see the whole code preview. Then the very next time you use it, it's back to its stupidly narrow size.

**Type inference is busted.** 

If you do something as standard as this, you get a type error on `f`, saying ""Expected type 'SupportsWrite[bytes]', got 'BufferedWriter' instead"":

    with open(filename, ""wb"") as f:
        pickle.dump(obj, f)

And I can't just disable the ""unexpected type"" code inspection--it's probably the single most valuable one. So I'm stuck with a lot of my files showing warnings that shouldn't be there. Which also keeps me from using the keyboard shortcut to bounce to any real problem of a lower severity.

If you're doing a comprehension inside a class method, and you name the iteration variable the same as a class attribute (e.g., you have `myclass.name`, and you do a comprehension like `[ ... for name in names]`, then the inferred type of the iteration variable overwrites the inferred type of the class attribute. This makes no sense--`name` and `self.name` have nothing to do with one another. This one is easy enough to work around by appending an underscore to the iteration variable's name, but it indicates something is very wrong under the hood.

There are several more specific type inference problems in my codebase, where my method clearly returns `MyType`, but PyCharm infers it as `MyType | None` and throws a warning. The method cannot possibly return `None`, and `mypy` agrees with me. So I'm stuck with another spurious warning.

These problems just never, ever get fixed, and they keep on accruing. Add it to the fact that JetBrains IDE's are always second in line for addon support, and I just couldn't justify sticking with it.

It's not about the keyboard shortcuts. Most of them don't even change if you use vim mode instead of standard editing--only the very few that conflict with a standard vim keystroke like ctrl-R for redo.

**You're not giving up any of the IDE's features whatsoever--they all remain available to you, and almost all of them remain relevant. Vim mode just changes the way you interact with the code while editing.**

It's not about renaming variables, either. I'd never do that with a vim command when the IDE will do it for me as needed in all files, and knows *not* to do it when the same name is used in different contexts.

It's just that once you get comfortable with it, it's *fluid* in a way that's hard to describe. For instance, if I've got six lines of code that I want to move up by twelve lines. With standard editing, I'd have to grab the mouse, or do a bunch of arrow-shift-arrow stuff. 

But in vim mode, it'll be something like `d6j12kp`. (And no, you don't have to count the lines--that's what ""relative line numbering"" is for!) Just moving around is better. If you want to go up 30 lines to do something, you don't grab the mouse or reach for an arrow key and hold it down, you just say `30k` and you're there. You're probably thinking about your next edit on the way, maybe even typing it without a pause. It's like a little language. It's efficient, and it's *fun*.

If I want to change a list comprehension to a set comprehension, then it's just `cs]}` with my cursor anywhere inside the comprehension. Enclose the rest of a line inside a function call, e.g., `var = foo` to `var = str(foo)`? It's `ys$fstr<enter>`. Now, that's not better than `str(`<end>`)`, but...

*Any* editing operation you've just done can be repeated with the `.` key. So if I've been doing that thing with `str(foo)` and I need to do it a few more times, it's probably just `n.n.n.` (next match, repeat command).

 I'm not saying those commands are intuitive if you're new to it, because they aren't. But imagine if it *was* second nature, how fast and comfortable it would be, to do everything so quickly without ever taking your fingers off the home row.

1jbv74v,Unvibe: Generate code that passes Unit-Tests,"    # What My Project Does
    Unvibe is a Python library to generate Python code that passes Unit-tests. 
    It works like a classic `unittest` Test Runner, but it searches (via Monte Carlo Tree Search) 
    a valid implementation that passes user-defined Unit-Tests. 
    
    # Target Audience (e.g., Is it meant for production, just a toy project, etc.)
    Software developers working on large projects
    
    # Comparison (A brief comparison explaining how it differs from existing alternatives.)
    It's a way to go beyond vibe coding for professional programmers dealing with large code bases.
    It's an alternative to using Cursor or Devon, which are more suited for generating quick prototypes.
    
    
    
    ## A different way to generate code with LLMs
    
    In my daily work as consultant, I'm often dealing with large pre-exising code bases.
    
    I use GitHub Copilot a lot.
    It's now basically indispensable, but I use it mostly for generating boilerplate code, or figuring out how to use a library.
    As the code gets more logically nested though, Copilot crumbles under the weight of complexity. It doesn't know how things should fit together in the project.
    
    Other AI tools like Cursor or Devon, are pretty good at generating quickly working prototypes,
    but they are not great at dealing with large existing codebases, and they have a very low success rate for my kind of daily work.
    You find yourself in an endless loop of prompt tweaking, and at that point, I'd rather write the code myself with
    the occasional help of Copilot.
    
    Professional coders know what code they want, we can define it with unit-tests, **we don't want to endlessly tweak the prompt.
    Also, we want it to work in the larger context of the project, not just in isolation.**
    In this article I am going to introduce a pretty new approach (at least in literature), and a Python library that implements it:
    a tool that generates code **from** unit-tests.
    
    **My basic intuition was this: shouldn't we be able to drastically speed up the generation of valid programs, while
    ensuring correctness, by using unit-tests as reward function for a search in the space of possible programs?**
    I looked in the academic literature, it's not new: it's reminiscent of the
    approach used in DeepMind FunSearch, AlphaProof, AlphaGeometry and other experiments like TiCoder: see [Research Chapter](
    #research
    ) for pointers to relevant papers.
    Writing correct code is akin to solving a mathematical theorem. We are basically proving a theorem
    using Python unit-tests instead of Lean or Coq as an evaluator.
    
    For people that are not familiar with Test-Driven development, read here about [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
    and [Unit-Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing).
    

    ## How it works
    
    I've implemented this idea in a Python library called Unvibe. It implements a variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search
    that invokes an LLM to generate code for the functions and classes in your code that you have
    decorated with `@ai`.
    
    Unvibe supports most of the popular LLMs: Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek.
    
    Unvibe uses the LLM to generate a few alternatives, and runs your unit-tests as a test runner (like `pytest` or `unittest`).
    **It then feeds back the errors returned by failing unit-test to the LLMs, in a loop that maximizes the number
    of unit-test assertions passed**. This is done in a sort of tree search, that tries to balance
    exploitation and exploration.
    
    As explained in the DeepMind FunSearch paper, having a rich score function is key for the success of the approach:
    You can define your tests by inherting the usual `unittests.TestCase` class, but if you use `unvibe.TestCase` instead
    you get a more precise scoring function (basically we count up the number of assertions passed rather than just the number
    of tests passed).
    
    It turns out that this approach works very well in practice, even in large existing code bases,
    provided that the project is decently unit-tested. This is now part of my daily workflow:
    
    1. Use Copilot to generate boilerplate code
    
    2. Define the complicated functions/classes I know Copilot can't handle
    
    3. Define unit-tests for those complicated functions/classes (quick-typing with GitHub Copilot)
    
    4. Use Unvibe to generate valid code that pass those unit-tests
    
    It also happens quite often that Unvibe find solutions that pass most of the tests but not 100%: 
    often it turns out some of my unit-tests were misconceived, and it helps figure out what I really wanted.

    often it turns out some of my unit-tests were misconceived, and it helps figure out what I really wanted.

Project Explanation: [https://claudio.uk/posts/unvibe.html](https://claudio.uk/posts/unvibe.html)","Unvibe Generate code that passes UnitTests What My Project Does Unvibe is a Python library to generate Python code that passes Unittests. It works like a classic unittest Test Runner, but it searches via Monte Carlo Tree Search a valid implementation that passes userdefined UnitTests. Target Audience e.g., Is it meant for production, just a toy project, etc. Software developers working on large projects Comparison A brief comparison explaining how it differs from existing alternatives. Its a way to go beyond vibe coding for professional programmers dealing with large code bases. Its an alternative to using Cursor or Devon, which are more suited for generating quick prototypes. A different way to generate code with LLMs In my daily work as consultant, Im often dealing with large preexising code bases. I use GitHub Copilot a lot. Its now basically indispensable, but I use it mostly for generating boilerplate code, or figuring out how to use a library. As the code gets more logically nested though, Copilot crumbles under the weight of complexity. It doesnt know how things should fit together in the project. Other AI tools like Cursor or Devon, are pretty good at generating quickly working prototypes, but they are not great at dealing with large existing codebases, and they have a very low success rate for my kind of daily work. You find yourself in an endless loop of prompt tweaking, and at that point, Id rather write the code myself with the occasional help of Copilot. Professional coders know what code they want, we can define it with unittests, we dont want to endlessly tweak the prompt. Also, we want it to work in the larger context of the project, not just in isolation. In this article I am going to introduce a pretty new approach at least in literature, and a Python library that implements it a tool that generates code from unittests. My basic intuition was this shouldnt we be able to drastically speed up the generation of valid programs, while ensuring correctness, by using unittests as reward function for a search in the space of possible programs? I looked in the academic literature, its not new its reminiscent of the approach used in DeepMind FunSearch, AlphaProof, AlphaGeometry and other experiments like TiCoder see Research Chapter research for pointers to relevant papers. Writing correct code is akin to solving a mathematical theorem. We are basically proving a theorem using Python unittests instead of Lean or Coq as an evaluator. For people that are not familiar with TestDriven development, read here about TDD and UnitTests How it works Ive implemented this idea in a Python library called Unvibe. It implements a variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search that invokes an LLM to generate code for the functions and classes in your code that you have decorated with . Unvibe supports most of the popular LLMs Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek. Unvibe uses the LLM to generate a few alternatives, and runs your unittests as a test runner like pytest or unittest. It then feeds back the errors returned by failing unittest to the LLMs, in a loop that maximizes the number of unittest assertions passed. This is done in a sort of tree search, that tries to balance exploitation and exploration. As explained in the DeepMind FunSearch paper, having a rich score function is key for the success of the approach You can define your tests by inherting the usual unittests.TestCase class, but if you use unvibe.TestCase instead you get a more precise scoring function basically we count up the number of assertions passed rather than just the number of tests passed. It turns out that this approach works very well in practice, even in large existing code bases, provided that the project is decently unittested. This is now part of my daily workflow 1. Use Copilot to generate boilerplate code 2. Define the complicated functionsclasses I know Copilot cant handle 3. Define unittests for those complicated functionsclasses quicktyping with GitHub Copilot 4. Use Unvibe to generate valid code that pass those unittests It also happens quite often that Unvibe find solutions that pass most of the tests but not 100 often it turns out some of my unittests were misconceived, and it helps figure out what I really wanted.

>This thing made me feel like I know nothing. It makes all my effort seem worthless it codes faster than me it looks better and it can optimize it's own code.

Does a calculator make you feel inadequate with its math knowledge and effortless computation speed? The answer to both should be yes. But that's fine, your job isn't to memorize and write the best code, your job is to do your job. Instead of an entry level code monkey, you're now a junior architect who is giving instructions to an ai code monkey, congratulations!

My advice is to get good at reading code and giving feedback. You don't want to let ai make any decisions on its own, that's how you get bad or even dangerous results. It might appear to perfectly understand simple problem domains but when it comes to solving business problems it might make an assumption that is the opposite of what you need or includes a fatal miscalculation. A good way to ensure the ai doesn't make too many decisions is to write or request that it writes stubs/signatures only and then put comments in the function body to precisely guide what it will create.

I shill it so much I feel like I should be paid to do so, but I'd also like to mention windsurf. If your company is already set with a dozen licenses or enterprise setup for cursor then so be it, but I enjoyed windsurf as an alternative for an ai integrated ide that can be instructed to code. I don't know what it does better or worse than cursor, but it's good to know what your options are.

Edit: oops, forgot to answer the question. Why learn? If it's your passion to compete with the calculator then keep practicing and you will get better. You need to think deep and ask yourself - what do you actually want? What is more important to you, being able to build a thing without the ai or that the thing gets built?

1. ML/Deep Learning techniques

How do you know when the LLM makes mistakes? Well it’s when their generated code fails the tests they themselves made based off project specs. 

I’ve gone through exercises where I will encourage juniors to actually come up with questions about their generated code. If you’re hellbent on them learning, why don’t you turn your “I fill your mind’s cup” into reviewing generated code so that you can discuss the common pitfalls.

1jaygyy,Learn JavaScript or soon obsolete with AI tools?,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently exploring startup ideas, mainly around web applications, and I have a big question about learning to code.

With the rise of platforms like Lovable, Bolt, Cursor, and Supabase, which speed up MVP development using vibe coding, is it still worth spending months learning JavaScript?

Honestly, I don’t want to invest 3–4 months learning it only to realize that in 6 months or a year, my skills are already outdated because these tools make development much faster, even for non-advanced coders. Is JavaScript still a valuable asset in this context, or should I focus on Python instead (especially for AI and back-end development)?

I also feel like AI integration has become almost mandatory for standing out in today’s startup world. For those who have launched a project, do you think it’s essential, or can a well-designed product still succeed without AI?

Lastly, if any of you have built a startup without technical skills or a network of developers, I’d love to hear your experience. How did you overcome that challenge?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and advice!",2025-03-14 03:36:42,0,4,0.27,learnprogramming,Flashy-Ad-5103,True,Reddit (r/learnprogramming),https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jaygyy/learn_javascript_or_soon_obsolete_with_ai_tools/,"Learn JavaScript or soon obsolete with AI tools?

I'm supposed to make a game in windows forms and I chose a top down shooter. I created a script to rotate a weapon around the player depending on where the mouse cursor is but now I need to rotate the weapon around itself so it always faces the curser.

1j92dpo,Can't remove bottom white space on horizontally sliding sections.,"Hello,

I've been scratching my head with this one for a bit - I am also not good at programming. I'm trying to create a portfolio website and I have a gallery on one of the pages. I have a fixed header with navigation elements in them that 'slide' horizontally between certain galleries on said page, they are: ""all"", ""macro"", ""marine"", and ""birdlife"".

  
I have four galleries but I'm focusing on ""all"" and ""macro"" for now. The problem is that ""all"" has more images in its gallery so it makes the page a lot longer - which creates a lot of white space under ""macro"". I have been trying to find a way to reduce this white space but I'm a bit stumped.

  
'Margin' and 'padding' don't work and neither do 'max-height'/'min-height'. I'm a bit worried that there isn't a solution as I realise all of these galleries are on the same page and thus have the same height no matter what.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I've been scratching my head with this one for a bit - I am also not good at programming. I'm trying to create a portfolio website and I have a gallery on one of the pages. I have a fixed header with navigation elements in them that 'slide' horizontally between certain galleries on said page, they are: ""all"", ""macro"", ""marine"", and ""birdlife"".

  
I have four galleries but I'm focusing on ""all"" and ""macro"" for now. The problem is that ""all"" has more images in its gallery so it makes the page a lot longer - which creates a lot of white space under ""macro"". I have been trying to find a way to reduce this white space but I'm a bit stumped.

  
'Margin' and 'padding' don't work and neither do 'max-height'/'min-height'. I'm a bit worried that there isn't a solution as I realise all of these galleries are on the same page and thus have the same height no matter what.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I would like your opinion on which tool to use to replace Cursor. I like how Cursor works, but I don't want to pay to access all the available features. I have a PC on which I run LM Studio with a Deepseek or Qwen model and I would like to use this instead of the online models via API, so I don't pay for the use because I run it locally. 

I would like to use VSC with some plugin that can connect to my machine with LM Studio and that can replicate the same functions as Cursor. For the functions I would like to have both the suggestions and the autocompletion, but above all the Composer (that function that allows me to create things from scratch starting from a description given in the chat).

1j3v1zi,I built a Cursor extension that actually REMEMBERS your codebase (because I'm tired of Cursor breaking my codebase every damn time),"Hey fellow devs,

After weeks of wanting to break my computer when Cursor kept breaking my code, I finally snapped and built something.

**The frustration we all know:**

* Explaining your project structure over and over and OVER again
* AI forgetting which libraries you're using after 3 messages
* Getting suggestions that completely ignore your architecture
* That sinking feeling when you realize the ""helpful"" AI just created 47 new bugs

**What I built:** A Cursor extension that creates and maintains a ""project brain"" - it's like giving AI a permanent memory of your codebase's context, architecture, and dev rules.

It works by:

* Creating a detailed spec file of your project's architecture decisions
* Maintaining awareness of file relationships and dependencies
* Actually understanding your tech stack choices (not just guessing)
* Auto-updating as your codebase evolves

**Early users report:**

* AI suggestions that actually make sense for their projects
* No more repeatedly explaining project structure
* Massive reduction in ""AI broke my code"" incidents

mg3zkjy,,"This is like creating md files, with specific instructions  
For Example,  
You create [ProjectStructure.md](http://ProjectStructure.md) , [Objectives.md](http://Objectives.md), [Guidelines.md](http://Guidelines.md), [Coding.md](http://Coding.md), [Frontend.md](http://Frontend.md), [backend.md](http://backend.md), [check.md](http://check.md)

You will mainly use [check.md](http://check.md)  
in there  
""ALWAYS"" means -> checking each content of every md file in detail without missing out any content

then say   
Always check  [ProjectStructure.md](http://ProjectStructure.md) , before creating any new file, and also update it before implementing the last file during composing.

Always use [Frontend.md](http://Frontend.md), if you are creating and detected editing a front end file.

Always use, check, and update [Objectives.md](http://Objectives.md) once implementing current and the next steps.  
........  
and this goes on ...............  
  
the good thing about this, is that you could create your own custom instructions based on the project, once you already used this once in the project, although it might not work at first, but you could improve it based on your own requirements  
  
for example, i had [Error.md](http://Error.md) file, i told cursor to always add linter errors, or any other errors that i paste for it solve in the  [Error.md](http://Error.md) file and how it solved it, it did not automatically add until i had to mention about it, or you could even write a run a script, for this.

I think memory is already there, its just based on instructions to add to train in more based on a user's requirement, because other's do not even need rules because of the way the do the prompting, which is very important, the way you word it makes a big difference, not just normal English.

Maybe you could create an Extension to install in Cursor about logging and learning from this Errors, like whatever the project you could use that log  
for example it would usually   
\-sometimes install uncompatible dependencies.  
\-keep { } in import statements that do not need.  
\-Typescript coding style errors,

So you could accumulate this, tell cursor to always check this log before implementing files, so that it could learn, I am sure this will reduce the struggles. 

Maybe another once would implementation style  
For example  
\-It implements modules that have not been installed yet, whereby it should first install all necessary modules then implement the files  
  
\-sometimes it suggests to use a library but that library does not support certain implementation style or variable, which causes alot of errors, whereby it should first check the requirement of your project, then check a library to is flexible supports our implementation requirements. 

Although some might argue that they still create completed projects without any of the above, but it would still better for a user to have there personal memory that there own cursor could use during implementations.  
  
  
Maybe there might be someone has created, but i dont think if its 100% functional meaning that cursor always uses and follows it during the implementations, i think some it might be there but cursor does not fetch it sometimes, and just goes based on its own LLM implementations, And we cant force it follow the memory but use, learn then implement, which should be done.",2025-03-05 02:12:41,4,0,0.0,cursor,[deleted],False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j3v1zi/i_built_a_cursor_extension_that_actually/mg3zkjy/,"This is like creating md files, with specific instructions

Before creating a class or a file, perform a search on the codebase, and check the memlogdirectory_tree for any previous implementations and utilize those. Never create unnecessary duplicate files. Validate all the tests and the builds to ensure correctness. All targets must pass. Never open or interact with the xcode GUI. Only use command line interface. Do not require user feedback for executing work already included in tasks.md, just execut the steps.

*Creates a .cursorrules file containing your project's architecture decisions*



*Auto-updates as your codebase evolves*



*Maintains awareness of file relationships and dependencies*



*Understands your tech stack choices and coding patterns*



*Integrates with git to track meaningful changes*

A suggestion: keep the possibility of simple editing a single file without an Agent like in 0.45 .

mioel7x,,">""does anybody else's cursor suddenly suck?!?!?!""

>No buddy, it's you. You're the problem. 

Not fair, because cursor versions have been getting shittier and shittier over time, i've been using it for almost a year now and i can easily tell it's downgraded in a lot of aspects, in fact i ran tests to confirm it, the tldr is that older versions of cursor have much bigger contexts and probably cost cursor more money, but they do output much better results, i've been using older cursor versions for a while now and i never looked back because they're really that much better.

Now normally someone would assume that's bs because this kind of things should happen on the serverside, and i agree ,but for some reason in cursor's case it's all client side and you can get completely different results based on what version you use.

one crazy example, a few weeks ago they changed the way the slow queue works so it takes longer and longer instead of passing you through the real queue, which results in you having to wait a lot longer if you use the slow queue too much.

Well guess what, if you use old versions you can access the old slow queue which works properly and save a lot of time, that alone is clear proof that most things are client-side, and that you can deal with the enshitification of cursor by just using an old version, the thing is they probably hate that you can do this so they removed the links from the site and force you to autoupdate no matter what so that you can't use old versions easily.",2025-03-19 16:10:08,0,0,0.0,cursor,TheNasky1,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1jexqmg/a_tale_of_two_cursor_users/mioel7x/,">""does anybody else's cursor suddenly suck?!?!?!""

The REAL ISSUE that most seem to not see is not the models (Although 3.7 CANT see the terminal most times and is a timid coder he likes to put placeholders a lot unlike 3.5 who actually tries to code meaningful work)

It's the d**n apply model it messes up the diffs very often despite the AI knowing what needs to be changed the edit_tool has a serious bug somewhere and a hard limit that the AI ignores as in ""don't write large files all at once you can't"" and boom fails because he's trying to make an 800 like file.

The real update would be to go full transparency and let US CONTROL the AI I should be able to set how long it's edits will be. How much of a file to read (the AI struggles very hard with reviewing its own work with the read tool)
and how often it should ask for user feedback.

There are a few more issues but the apply model and DIFF edits malfunctioning ruin my code often with massive indentation issues and Sonnet will even get frustrated and call out the malfunction with Cursor doing things like dropping the read/edit tool all together and frustratingly try to use the terminal instead and usually always forgets we are on Powershell but that an Anthropic issue not Cursor

I work with AI to code every single day all day because my life depends on it so even with issues you can still do the work but these last few updates starting from the MCP release has made cursor much worse.

1j7pnoo,Karpathy completely changed the way I use Cursor,"I’ve been coding for years, but I never realized how much time I wasted typing until I stumbled on a video of Andrej Karpathy coding entirely with his voice. I thought it was just a gimmick. But turns out, dictating prompts for Cursor works super well and a lot faster than typing.

It lets me articulate longer prompts without breaking flow and it’s easier describing logical flows. Apparently 3x faster on average compared to typing. For example, dictating a complex API query prompt now takes seconds of braindumping with my voice instead of minutes.

I made a review of all the tools I’ve tested so y’all don’t have to waste money like I did:

Apple Dictation

* Pros: Free and built into macOS.
* Cons: Doesn’t get any technical terms right and ignores punctuation. Fine for a short message, useless for actual accuracy. It also breaks my flow waiting for the words to load in.

Willow Voice

* Pros: Formats paragraphs, adds punctuation intuitively, and handles my filler words. Accuracy and latency are very good.
* Cons: Subscription model, so whatever I pay for it

Aiko

* Pros: Offline and based locally so that I can trust it.
* Cons: No auto-formatting. Latency isn’t as good as other AI tools. My Mac’s fans sound like a jet engine during long sessions.

Dragon NaturallySpeaking

* Pros: Pretty much just legacy at this point
* Cons: It’s abandoned on Mac. Buggy, expensive, and stuck in 2010. Can’t believe I paid hundreds to try this.

It’s way too eager, constantly trying to do stuff in the code even when you don’t ask it to. 
It straight-up ignores serious linter errors and always over-engineers everything. 
It also ignores rules - like if you say DRY, KISS, and YAGNI, it still keeps overthinking. 
It hyper-focuses on some problem, overanalyzes it, and immediately tries to “fix” it. And that sucks.

1j8qb1f,An ex-Visual Studio engineer's thoughts on Cursor,"We first introduced code completion (one of our marketing ""wizards"" named it *IntelliSence*) for Visual Studio in 1996. The way we figured out ""what came next"" back then wouldn't even remotely be thought of as ""AI"" by modern standards. Most of the ""magic"" relied heavily on lightweight background compilers to figure out things like, ""What existing variable names can be placed here that would compile cleanly?""

I eventually left MS to join the Xcode team at Apple. In total, I spent 16 years helping to create tools aimed specifically at software engineers. In that time I learned a great deal about how people of all experience levels interact with these types of tools.

Why the history lesson? Because back then there were ""purist"" developers who absolutely refused to enable features like IntelliSense. A lot of the initial feedback was, ""Real developers write their own code! You're going to turn developers into idiots!"" And remember, all we were really doing back then was suggesting the next variable or displaying possible parameters for a function.

I retired a few years ago and now spend a ton of my time volunteering to help individuals and startups solve technical problems. I still write code every day.

After two solid months of very slowly incorporating Cursor into my workflow I am 100% sold on its functionality. I constantly bump into experienced developers who are in the anti-Cursor camp until I show them how I use the tool. I'm not a ""vibe coder"" (what a ridiculous term) by any means but there have been countless times I had an idea for a feature that I let Cursor take a few shots at. In one instance it chose an algorithm I was unfamiliar with and worked perfectly. I love the freedom of being able to try out even crazy ideas in a frictionless, risk free, and timely manner.

It is awesome seeing VS Code being used in this way. It took over a *decade* to convince the company that a ""baby"" version of Visual Studio would be useful and I'm so glad to see that decision pay off.

The days of ""LLMs can't code"" are over. Anyone who bothers to take a deep dive understands that. Do we still need to ensure the code is correct? Of course... but that is true of code written by even the most experienced human engineer. I don't implicitly trust *anyone's* code. ;-) 

 That said, I would absolutely love to see models that are trained on real-world debugging scenarios. VS Code has some incredibly useful debugging facilities that Cursor should be able to integrate with directly. For example, if I stop at a breakpoint Cursor should be able to inspect the callstack and automatically examine the code at previous levels to determine if a bug happened earlier in the code execution, detect race conditions, etc. Anyone who has wasted days trying to track down complex threading/deadlock issues would love these types of features.

mh8q776,,"**Hi,**

I completely share your perspective and mindset. As it stands, these approaches excel as coding productivity tools—but they are not a replacement for creating good software solutions.

We are currently rolling out Cursor for all developers (on a non-mandatory basis). The ones who find it a bit more challenging are .NET C# backend developers who are accustomed to Visual Studio.

Interestingly, we just hired a recent graduate specializing in Data Science and Cognition to support the AI team. From a “low-level” tech perspective, his experience is primarily in Python and C. I introduced him to Cursor, and naturally, he used Python Notebooks to experiment with potential solutions to the problems I assigned him. However, I told him, *“This is great, but we need a UI so that non-technical users can better understand how it behaves. Do you know React, HTML, or JavaScript to build a basic UI for demonstration?”* He didn’t.

So, I had another team member showcase how Cursor could help him quickly build a simple page with the assistance of the AI agent. Without prior knowledge of HTML, he created a small UI for his prototype in just a day.

This was impressive—but in no way was the result production-ready. However, it provided a tangible feel for the solution and its technical challenges. I think this is where some people might get carried away; the results look ""magical"" for todays standards, but…

Maybe I’m just getting old, but I remain skeptical of these new platforms that promote *no-code* as a pathway to successful software solutions. Beyond prototyping, I wouldn’t rely on these approaches for large-scale, production-grade applications—at least not yet. That said, one of the strengths of tools like Cursor is their ability to bridge the gap between rapid prototyping and fully developed, production-ready solutions.

Additionally, I see great potential in integrating these technologies with solid *low-code* platforms like OutSystems, particularly for building standard line-of-business (LoB) applications and integration solutions. I think this is an exciting area of development for such platforms.

**Cheers.**

1j8vgot,Cursor 0.47 is so disappointing.,"I think this update made EVERYONE feel undervalued, I just canceled my Cursor subscription, and will switch to windsurf until this issue with cursor is resolved.

Download an install from [https://www.cursor.com/downloads](https://www.cursor.com/downloads)

**New Features**

* **Chat/Composer Unification:** We heard your feedback and have unified Chat, Composer and Agent into a single interface. Switch between modes as your needs change with each task during your session.
* **UI Glow Up:** Our new unified chat interface includes several design improvements to de-clutter the UI and improve your flow. Three new themes designed for the Cursor UI are now available. To select a theme, go to Settings > Theme > Color Theme in the Cursor menu.
* **Agent Web Access:** Agent now proactively searches the web to find information when needed without having to include \`@web\` in your prompts.
* **Secure .cursorignore:** New security rules ensure that files listed in .cursorignore are never shared with LLMs or seen by Cursor. The new .cursorindexignore file supports the previous ignore functionality that only limits files from indexing.
* **Agent Tool Limit:** When reaching the 25 tool call limit, the Agent now displays a button to continue beyond this limit with a single click. Bypassing the limit consumes an extra request.
* **New MCP Features:** MCP gains new features like Yolo mode, the ability to configure Project Servers with .cursor/mcp.json, and the ability for Agent to use MCP resources as context.
* **Improved Project Rules:** A visual indicator is now shown anytime a rules set is applied to a request, and rules can now be applied globally.
* **Claude 3.7 Sonnet:** Support for our newest Premium models from Anthropic, Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking - both enabled for Agent.

**Fixes**

* **Crash Fixes:** Several memory, performance and reliability improvements.
* **MCP Fixes**: Reliability and quality of life fixes to make building MCP servers in Cursor even better.
* **Windows Fixes**:

Since then, I’ve encountered multiple issues. The most concerning ones include:

* It modified my `.xcodeproj` file, even though I never instructed it to do so, nor should it have been reading or modifying that file in the first place.
* It generated three copies of another file without any reason to do so.
* When I explicitly asked it to analyze an issue in a specific file, it not only analyzed it but also implemented various ""solutions"" on its own, which introduced multiple errors that I’m still trying to fix.
* Instead of analyzing the entire file as requested, it only considered a portion of it, then proceeded to modify the file based solely on that incomplete analysis. While this was easy to correct, it highlighted how easily it gets confused.

Overall, Sonnet 3.7 is generating files unnecessarily, duplicating existing files, modifying things it shouldn’t, and acting autonomously in ways that disrupt my workflow. Since encountering these issues, I’ve switched back to Sonnet 3.5, which remains the most stable version for me.

mh95n1f,,"Hi! Thanks for doing this.

  
I started using cursor a few weeks ago, and I really liked it. However, it wasn't until sonnet 3.7 dropped that it really blew my mind. This was a couple of weeks ago roughly. I remember asking for a complex test suite and providing a lot of context, writing a long prompt, and composer one-shot it. As I was reading the generated code, I couldn't believe it.

But, I was quickly disappointed after updating Cursor (I think it was to 0.46, not entirely sure). Suddenly it was reading files slower, in chunks, but even for smaller tasks it seemed to be way less effective - missing existing functions in the files provided as context, etc. This has been the case ever since the composer was removed.

What changes, if any, did you make during this time period? Are there any plans on improving this? Reading through this subreddit, I saw several similar experiences.

mhba5sn,,"I think having multiple specialised agents would be very beneficial. Currently with one you try to curate your cursor rules and prompting and keep adding to it whenever cursor does something you think it shouldn't or could do better with better rules/pre-prompt. But eventually you're giving it so much with that it seems like it can't remember it all and a lot of the rules or pre-prompt eventually gets ignored. 


Perhaps with multiple specialised agents it would allow us to split up those rules and pre-prompts among multiple agents so each doesn't have to remember so much and each has only the rules that are specific to it's task type. Plus with longer rules and pre-prompts theres a higher chance of unintentional contradiction that can ""confuse"" the model.

As you can see, I had to start manually tagging my various `.mdc` files in each prompt to make sure they got picked up.

I've been thinking about what could be the problem, by the way. I have been running this repo since cursor 0.43.

1. Do you think the codebase index got corrupted somewhere between the major versions? Perhaps I could regenerate from scratch?
2. My other idea is that my backend repo is just too big to use with Cursor's latest summarisation logic. The whole thing is over 100k lines of code. In Cline, without using Repomix, 30-60 minutes of prompting results in a context window of 500k tokens. This may explain why things are constantly being pruned out of Agent's mind. I should say though that my functions are well split, a single file is always less than 250 LOC and test files are usually under 1k.
3. I looked through my PRs and since Cursor 0.45 I have only added 20k LOC, so Composer *was* crushing an 85k LOC project before 0.46. It really seems like something happened around the decommissioning of Chat/Composer moment.

Over the last week my usage of Agent has evolved to only working on single file refactors and very limited scope work. Kind of a like a juiced up Cmd+K. It seems to do OK on these but can no longer work from specification documents like it used to.

I would really like to get Cursor back to where it was before. I am literally happy to 5-10x my monthly bill if that's what it takes. Please let me know how I can help.

I've been using Cursor to build [RangeMint](http://rangemint.ca), an outdoor adventure guide focused on Alberta, Canada. It helps people discover great fishing spots, camping areas, and scenic locations, all through an interactive map built with OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.

I have a laravel project that uses Google login exclusively, cursor knows this but when changing the styles of the edit user view it added in password boxes which weren't there previously. I replied ""you've added password boxes to the edit user view, we don't need those and should be there as we use Google auth exclusively"".

It replied with ""I can't see the password boxes on the view, let me investigate what other problem there might be. Oh, you're right there are password fields on the view that we don't need"".

Not a big deal, but a bit annoying.

I will add, however, that cursor is allowing me to create projects i could only dream of creating previously as a complete novice.

1jd4s83,My Cursor AI Workflow That Actually Works,"I’ve been coding with Cursor AI since it was launched now while building my SaaS, and I’ve got some thoughts.

The internet seems split between “AI coding is a miracle” and “AI coding is garbage.” Honestly, it’s somewhere in between.

Some days Cursor helps me complete tasks in record times. Other days I waste hours fighting its suggestions.

After learning from my mistakes, I wanted to share what actually works for me as a solo developer. 

## Setting Up a .cursorrules File That Actually Helps

The biggest game-changer for me was creating a `.cursorrules` file. It’s basically a set of instructions that tells Cursor how to generate code for your specific project.

Mine core file is pretty simple — just about 10 lines covering the most common issues I’ve encountered. For example, Cursor kept giving comments rather than writing the actual code. One line in my rules file fixed it forever.

Here’s what the start of my file looks like:

```
* Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
* Never replace code with placeholders like `// ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
* Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
* Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
* Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.
```

Don’t overthink your rules file. Start small and add to it whenever you notice Cursor making the same mistake twice. You don’t need any long or complicated rules, Cursor is using state of the art models and already knows most of what there is to know.

I continue the rest of the “rules” file with a detailed technical overview of my project. I describe what the project is for, how it works, what important files are there, what are the core algorithms used, and any other details depending on the project. I used to do that manually, but now I just use my own tool to generate it.

## Giving Cursor the Context It Needs

My biggest “aha moment” came when I realized Cursor works way better when it can see similar code I’ve already written.

Now instead of just asking “Make a dropdown menu component,” I say “Make a dropdown menu component similar to the Select component in `u/components/Select.tsx`.”

This tiny change made the quality of suggestions way better. The AI suddenly “gets” my coding style and project patterns. I don’t even have to tell it exactly what to reference — just pointing it to similar components helps a ton.

For larger projects, you need to start giving it more context. Ask it to create rules files inside `.cursor/rules` folder that explain the code from different angles like backend, frontend, etc. 

## My Daily Cursor Workflow

In the morning when I’m sharp, I plan out complex features with minimal AI help. This ensures critical code is solid.

I then work with the Agent mode to actually write them one by one, in order of most difficulty. I make sure to use the “Review” button to read all the code, and keep changes small and test them live to see if they actually work.

For tedious tasks like creating standard components or writing tests, I lean heavily on Cursor. Fortunately, such boring tasks in software development are now history.

For tasks more involved with security, payment, or auth; I make sure to test fully manually and also get Cursor to write automated unit tests, because those are places where I want full peace of mind.

When Cursor suggests something, I often ask “Can you explain why you did it this way?” This has caught numerous subtle issues before they entered my codebase. 

## Avoiding the Mistakes I Made

If you’re trying Cursor for the first time, here’s what I wish I’d known:

* Be super cautious with AI suggestions for authentication, payment processing, or security features. I manually review these character by character.
* When debugging with Cursor, always ask it to explain its reasoning. I’ve had it confidently “fix” bugs by introducing even worse ones.
* Keep your questions specific. “Fix this component” won’t work. “Update the onClick handler to prevent form submission” works much better.
* Take breaks from AI assistance. I often code without Cursor and came back with a better sense of when to use it.

## Moving Forward with AI Tools

Despite the frustrations, I’m still using Cursor daily. It’s like having a sometimes-helpful junior developer on your team who works really fast but needs supervision.

I’ve found that being specific, providing context, and always reviewing suggestions has transformed Cursor from a risky tool into a genuine productivity booster for my solo project.

The key for me has been setting boundaries. Cursor helps me write code faster, but I’m still the one responsible for making sure that code works correctly.

2. **Tech stack** and **languages used**
3. **Type of problems** faced
4. **Type of AI models** used (Grok, Claude 3.5 sonnet) etc

**Then added short dense informational points on**

* The best practices to follow
* 70+ Common mistakes to avoid

And an additional resource for you amazing folks, **curated 7+ high quality demos on cursor agent interactions**.

The website [http://cursorintro.com/](http://cursorintro.com/) is a one stop place for many tips for beginners to get started quickly.

mf4pqpq,,"The annoying part with AI is that there’s not really a clear-cut point where things start going wrong.

That said, I usually find that the second you start working on a problem that doesn’t have a commonly known solution, even if you describe your solution in detail to the point that any intern could pick up the task, there’s a pretty decent chance you’ll get a bad response.

In particular, when a codebase gets large enough (spread across multiple entry point apps and libs), I’ve found cursor starts to hallucinate dependencies, types, enum members, etc. Yes, even when I include the specific files to be used as dependencies. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great at what it does, but a single hallucinated dependency can easily ruin an entire set of output and clarifying further usually does not help.

I find it especially bad for making small specific changes, as just manually coding the solution with the help of cursor tab is WAY faster than writing up a plain-English description.

I’ve personally found my best workflow to be:
- Use composer for new files that need boilerplate while providing copious examples of similar files
- Use agent mode for writing tests
- Use chat mode like a rubber duck that knows how to code
- Use cursor tab + manual coding for everything else (it catches on VERY quickly)

Building an optimized web app isn’t that hard with cursor. You just gotta look at the complexity of that app. There is stuff that will be hard for someone clueless in cursor when it gets too complicated but some basic stuff using APIs and existing libraries? No problem.

But at the end I also have the feeling, the knowledge that you say someone “needs” can kinda be replaced with more grind in many instances. Also those arguments always read like they expect the non developer to be entirely stupid… you can still find out correct approaches to achieve your goals without knowing them at the beginning of the project.. just be honest with yourself and research the things you don’t know… with AI that’s as easy as never before…

The knowledgeable web dev will be way quicker achieving his stuff in cursor because he won’t do all kinds of stupid prompts.

But I would disagree in the notion that it’s impossible to also achieve it without actually being a dev… Just gotta box you out of the endless loops of errors when you don’t understand the issues (or just try again with a different prompt (or just ask for potential solutions and then go over to fix stuff)

What is the superior code worth with a trashy concept?

Given I don’t know what you are building I can assume though that you are giving instructions in English that when translated into code by AI are actually closer to code than you might realize.

This is conceptually similar to when higher level languages like JavaScript or Python were created to simplify programming and got compiled down into assembly or c++. 

I’m sure there were people at the time who thought coding like that wasn’t real coding because real coding was writing straight assembly. But almost all coding became using higher level languages because it saved so much time.

1j1kemq,"Cursor is a Game-Changer, But You Still Need the Basics","I’ve been in software engineering for over 20 years and hold a PhD in ML. I love Cursor—it’s an incredible tool that can 10x productivity, especially when working within a known language or framework.

For my daily work, I primarily use Python, and most of the time, I know 90% of what needs to be done (the rest I look up along the way). In these cases, Cursor is amazing. It speeds up development, helps with boilerplate code, and fills in gaps efficiently.

However, I’ve also tested Cursor on technologies I wasn’t familiar with. I built a web app in Next.js despite having only worked with Angular before. While I eventually completed the project, it took a lot of iterations and requests. Then, I tried building an iOS app with SwiftUI. This time, I burned through countless requests, got stuck, and ultimately couldn’t finish it. At some point, it felt like I might succeed, but I realized I was just patching things together without fully understanding how they worked.

This experience taught me a key lesson: AI can help tremendously, but it’s not a shortcut to deep understanding. Trying to build a production-ready app without grasping the framework’s core concepts leads to frustration and wasted time. Now, I’ve decided to properly learn SwiftUI before attempting another project.

My advice? Before diving into a new stack, take time to understand its fundamentals—basic building blocks, core patterns, and underlying concepts.

For my daily work, I primarily use Python, and most of the time, I know 90% of what needs to be done (the rest I look up along the way). In these cases, Cursor is amazing. It speeds up development, helps with boilerplate code, and fills in gaps efficiently.

However, I’ve also tested Cursor on technologies I wasn’t familiar with. I built a web app in Next.js despite having only worked with Angular before. While I eventually completed the project, it took a lot of iterations and requests. Then, I tried building an iOS app with SwiftUI. This time, I burned through countless requests, got stuck, and ultimately couldn’t finish it. At some point, it felt like I might succeed, but I realized I was just patching things together without fully understanding how they worked.

This experience taught me a key lesson: AI can help tremendously, but it’s not a shortcut to deep understanding. Trying to build a production-ready app without grasping the framework’s core concepts leads to frustration and wasted time. Now, I’ve decided to properly learn SwiftUI before attempting another project.

My advice? Before diving into a new stack, take time to understand its fundamentals—basic building blocks, core patterns, and underlying concepts.

1j7rdoa,I use Cursor daily - here's how I avoid the garbage parts,"AI for coding is in a weird spot right now.

You get people claiming that you can build a complete SaaS in 3 days, and others saying that it's worse than useless. Both of these people are probably just exaggerating or straight up lying.

I love coding with Cursor, it's completely changed the way I code, but it's also complete garbage a good deal of the time.

So as an AI skeptic I'll tell you everything I know to make your experience as good as possible.

If you prefer watching rather than reading, here’s a [YT video with the same content.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC2b7wMfalI)

## CursorRules

Let's start with an easy one. 

If you don't have a .cursorrules file you are missing out.

You can have one ready to go in about 10 minutes, and it will save you hours of time.

Look up your stack on this [list of cursorrules](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules?tab=readme-ov-file#contents) and pull out the best bits.

But my advice is to keep it reasonably minimal and then build on it over time.

You don't need this massive file with every single programming best practice outlined.

The reason for shitty AI output is not because it forgot about DRY or SOLID. And I find that giving it too much input, and having longer chats, is when it starts to fall apart a bit. So keep it light. And here's the thing: if you notice the same issues popping up again and again, just add a quick line telling it not to. Or even better, in your cursor chat just say please write me a cursorrule so that you stop doing this particular thing. And then chuck it in there.

Like mine will keep forgetting about nullish coallescing (??) in JS, and even after I fix it up it will revert my change in its future changes. So of course I put that rule in and it won't happen again.

And then at the top of the file, just write some text about what the project is about. If you have a particular file structure and way of organising code that is great to put in as well.

## Getting the best output

I have found *by far* the best thing for improving the output is telling it exactly where to find the code it might otherwise spit out at you. 

Like if you know it's going to need a certain function, or create a procedure very similar to something that exists, give it that context. And you don't necessarily need to tell it the exact function - we're trying to make our lives easier here, of course I still want this to be easier than just writing the code myself. 

After I tell it what I want I often just do a `see @schedule.ts @utils.ts @ScheduleHeader.tsx` and just include anything that will help it do its task - even in a more abstract ""here's how something vaguely similar has been done"" kind of way. 

The AI has been trained on a bunch of random code, so if there's anything particular to your project, then you need to tell it.

## Random tips

Okay and let's get into some rapid fire tips.

- I like Composer (Agent) for simple, low impact changes. And Chat (Ask) for everything else. Just the step of manually having to click apply and taking that extra second to think about the changes it's making, and in which files it's happening, rather than just be presented with a wave of green changes ready to get smashed in.
- Don't blindly accept code. It's always gonna come back to bite you.
- Every so often make sure you read and fully understand the most integral parts of your code, and refactor it *manually.* You will find a lot of gaps, and fixing it up means future AI-written code will be better.
- Ask ""is this the best way to do this?"" or ""have you considered xyz"".
- Learn when a problem is best solved manually.
- Take extra care when using AI to fix bugs. I think it's particularly weak at fixing anything but the silliest of bugs. And it can cause a lot of damage in the process.
- If it's a big and important task or you are setting the foundations for a feature, ask it to ask you any questions before writing code to make sure it has a full understanding of what you are trying to do.

One of the best things about AI is that you can now write code when your brain is fried, and tackling a problem would normally be outside of your reach.

It's great for sitting on the couch and cranking out some mostly decent code, but then other days of course you just spend an hour chasing ""You're right"" ""I see the issue now"" only to end up in a worse place than you started.

But I would recommend experimenting with it and learning how best to talk to it. It's not going away, and it's just another tool that you can use.

And if you're a junior developer I would of course be very wary with it. And anyone for that matter really. I do think there's something to be said for the atrophying of my coding skills.

But I would recommend experimenting with it and learning how best to talk to it. It's not going away, and it's just another tool that you can use.

And if you're a junior developer I would of course be very wary with it. And anyone for that matter really. I do think there's something to be said for the atrophying of my coding skills.

Thanks for reading :) Hope it was valuable","I use Cursor daily heres how I avoid the garbage parts AI for coding is in a weird spot right now. You get people claiming that you can build a complete SaaS in 3 days, and others saying that its worse than useless. Both of these people are probably just exaggerating or straight up lying. I love coding with Cursor, its completely changed the way I code, but its also complete garbage a good deal of the time. So as an AI skeptic Ill tell you everything I know to make your experience as good as possible. If you prefer watching rather than reading, heres a YT video with the same content. CursorRules Lets start with an easy one. If you dont have a .cursorrules file you are missing out. You can have one ready to go in about 10 minutes, and it will save you hours of time. Look up your stack on this list of cursorrules and pull out the best bits. But my advice is to keep it reasonably minimal and then build on it over time. You dont need this massive file with every single programming best practice outlined. The reason for shitty AI output is not because it forgot about DRY or SOLID. And I find that giving it too much input, and having longer chats, is when it starts to fall apart a bit. So keep it light. And heres the thing if you notice the same issues popping up again and again, just add a quick line telling it not to. Or even better, in your cursor chat just say please write me a cursorrule so that you stop doing this particular thing. And then chuck it in there. Like mine will keep forgetting about nullish coallescing ?? in JS, and even after I fix it up it will revert my change in its future changes. So of course I put that rule in and it wont happen again. And then at the top of the file, just write some text about what the project is about. If you have a particular file structure and way of organising code that is great to put in as well. Getting the best output I have found by far the best thing for improving the output is telling it exactly where to find the code it might otherwise spit out at you. Like if you know its going to need a certain function, or create a procedure very similar to something that exists, give it that context. And you dont necessarily need to tell it the exact function were trying to make our lives easier here, of course I still want this to be easier than just writing the code myself. After I tell it what I want I often just do a see .ts .ts .tsx and just include anything that will help it do its task even in a more abstract heres how something vaguely similar has been done kind of way. The AI has been trained on a bunch of random code, so if theres anything particular to your project, then you need to tell it. Random tips Okay and lets get into some rapid fire tips. I like Composer Agent for simple, low impact changes. And Chat Ask for everything else. Just the step of manually having to click apply and taking that extra second to think about the changes its making, and in which files its happening, rather than just be presented with a wave of green changes ready to get smashed in. Dont blindly accept code. Its always gonna come back to bite you. Every so often make sure you read and fully understand the most integral parts of your code, and refactor it manually. You will find a lot of gaps, and fixing it up means future AIwritten code will be better. Ask is this the best way to do this? or have you considered xyz. Learn when a problem is best solved manually. Take extra care when using AI to fix bugs. I think its particularly weak at fixing anything but the silliest of bugs. And it can cause a lot of damage in the process. If its a big and important task or you are setting the foundations for a feature, ask it to ask you any questions before writing code to make sure it has a full understanding of what you are trying to do. One of the best things about AI is that you can now write code when your brain is fried, and tackling a problem would normally be outside of your reach. Its great for sitting on the couch and cranking out some mostly decent code, but then other days of course you just spend an hour chasing Youre right I see the issue now only to end up in a worse place than you started.

Saves us a ton of time on boilerplate code and enforces best engineering practices on code we craft ourselves. Just be wary that at times it goes off the rails and so you still need to guide it accordingly.

1jf4jft,Why developers are feeling frustrated with Cursor - a personal journey,"I've been using Cursor since the early days, and it's been quite the rollercoaster. I wanted to share my personal experience because I think it could explain why so many devs are upset lately.

When I first got Cursor, I couldn't really see the value. It was basically just a chat interface with GitHub Copilot features. I paid for a license but found myself wondering if it was worth it.

Then they added automatic code updates which were a complete mess. They broke my code almost every time, so I ended up using Claude separately and copy-pasting the code manually.

The real turning point came when they integrated Claude's API with Sonnet 3.5, added Checkpoints, and introduced the AGENT feature. That was genuinely great! I stopped using external chat tools and went all-in on Cursor. The AGENT was solid, the context window was excellent, and coding felt amazing. This was the golden age.

But then version 0.46 happened, and everything went downhill. Even 0.45 with Sonnet 3.7 was unstable but still pretty good. After 0.46, things really fell apart.

My theory? Instead of being transparent and saying ""Hey, we're not making enough money, we need to limit premium model access"" and giving users options to upgrade or pay-as-you-go, they started messing with core features. They changed the context window, modified how the agent worked, and tweaked other stuff that seriously damaged the user experience.

That's why, even though Cursor is fundamentally a good tool, they some how disappointed users right when they had momentum. And that's really hard to recover from. Users forget quickly and move on to try other solutions.

Now I'm looking at Claude Desktop with MCP and Claude Code, wondering why I should keep using a sophisticated and heavy IDE when the coding experience has changed so much anyway.

Don't get me wrong, I still love using Cursor and I see how the team listen to users. Just a year ago I would never have imagined programming like this. It's genuinely revolutionary. But do you think they're losing momentum?

Im confused as why ppl think Claude code is so good. It doesnt allow you to specify context so it just feels like it could go all over the place.

Seriously though try out all the tools if you can and you will quickly form your own opinion.

I think the reason why this space is so chaotic is you have people at all different skill levels learning all sorts of diff tools and finding out what works best for them without ever evaluating their own human side of the equation.

Learn and play with them all until you feel like you don't have to and form an opinion on your own.

Plus IMO Brand loyalty is stupid here.

Every few months a new winner emerges cuz of how fast this space is evolving, it would be silly to settle on a horse in such a volatile market.

Less theorycrafting, more playgrounding

My code is still way too convoluted and complicated to let an AI touch it really, but I am refactoring the code slowly and introducing unit tests and integration tests everywhere. Having the AI write unit tests for me is really fantastic - as a solo dev, I really was lazy before and never bothered, but AI makes adding unit tests a lot easier and you can then go tweak those unit tests to be more comprehensive.

I've definitely found that if you don't give the AI context, it can really mess with your shit. Like today, I'd asked it about how it would approach a problem, so then I said ok go - add that solution to this file. What did it do? It replaced the entire 2000 line file with its own 50 lines of code...

Obviously I use git, so I reverted and then implemented the edits myself, but really this was my fault as the AI had very little context about this particular piece of code I was editing.

So - I'm heading towards having comprehensive unit tests, but that's not enough on its own (who's to say the AI won't just change your unit test so that the broken code passes? It has happened to me before!)

The extra stuff the AI really needs is an architectural overview of the work and a current-state-of-play. I found this really comprehensive article yesterday that I think we all should read:

mea3atj,,"I don't fully agree with your viewpoint, but I understand and respect your decision.

Perhaps because you're so familiar with technical details, you don't feel the need for AI assistance. Everyone is at different levels and stages, so their requirements for AI will vary accordingly.

For me, AI programming, especially Cursor, is incredibly useful! It brings back that initial feeling of learning to program - that sensation of solving problems with simple thinking. Programming should serve to complete tasks, and if there's a simple way to achieve it, it shouldn't be complicated. When I first learned VB or C, I felt programming was truly enjoyable. Simple tasks could be completed easily, and even complex tasks felt manageable by combining a series of simple methods.

But what has programming become in recent years? New frameworks appear almost every month, each with its own set of complex rules. Now, even implementing the simplest task has become very complicated. For example, adding a browser control to a window - in VB, you could just drag and drop the control, and a few lines of code would complete many tasks. After switching to the .NET platform, this same task became extremely complex. I've done this type of design several times, but I still can't remember how to do it and need to refer to my notes.

Now AI handles all these complex details for you, eliminating the complexity of these frameworks. It allows people to have an easier time. However, AI applications might gradually become more complex themselves - this seems to be a general rule of how things work, and might be unavoidable.

Hi,

[https://x.com/kregenrek/status/1892884736059613652](https://x.com/kregenrek/status/1892884736059613652)

**UI Update:**

Cursor 0.46 is here and we got some fresh UI Updates.  
  
Chat -> Ask  
Composer (normal) -> Edit  
Composer (agent) -> Agent  
  
You can switch between modes with ⌘+.

**You can reference the terminal:**

https://reddit.com/link/1iuvain/video/e0iihjnwsike1/player

**Git Reference:**

Cursor 0.46 explains you what happened in a specific Git Commit.

https://reddit.com/link/1iuvain/video/lbfq3ajasike1/player

**No window switch anymore**

You can now switch between modes within the same context.  
  
For example, you can ask something and then start the agent based on that or vice versa. This eliminates the need to transfer context between windows.

TBH this is still confusing. I liked the old version better where don't had two buttons with the same highlighting style. It's like having a ""Ok"" and ""Confirm"" button. It also seems to be a bit buggy. If you apply and reapply files a few times, you don't get any changes.

3. ""Add logging statements for us to assess root cause""

2. Adding proper log statements
3. Its own testing via curl in terminal for the API in the app

I built an iOS app and launched it at the beginning of February. It was my first app ever and I’ve never written a line of code. 

This video helped my immensely with getting started and I probably wouldn’t have even tried if I didn’t watch it. https://youtu.be/oe3Jn6FRoII?si=fvphNHdKWIEr0KNG

As for the person saying that everything’s already been made. Idk if that’s trolling or serious, but that’s a very closed minded way of thinking and nothing would ever be accomplished if everyone thought like that. 

It’s true that people probably have 90 percent of the apps they’ll ever use already on their phone but there’s still room for new apps so long as they’re useful. If your plan is to create a to-do list, or an AI powered calorie tracking app you’re probably not going to have much luck because I see a new one almost every day.

1jfj3zh,RELEASED: Run ANY AI model (GROQ +LOCAL) in Cursor with unlimited tool usage (no more Max API limitations!),"Due to Cursor's recent Max API changes, I decided to publicly release my custom Cursor model implementation so everyone can use ANY model they want on Cursor at cost with as many tool requests as they want.

**IMPORTANT: I HAVE NOT TESTED THE TEMPLATE FILE, THAT IS A TEMPLATE FILE GENERATED FROM THE EXPERIMENT THAT I MADE FROM COMBINING R1 + QWEN TOGETHER INTO A REASONING MODEL. CHECKOUT R1SONQWEN FOR A WORKING IMPLEMENTATION**

## What Is This?

A proxy server that lets you use alternative AI models with Cursor IDE:
- 🚀 Full Cursor compatibility with **ANY** AI provider
- 💰 Only pay for tokens you use (no subscription)
- 🔧 Unlimited tool calls
- 🔄 Works with Groq, Anthropic, Google, local models, etc.

My specific implementation combines **Deepseek's R1 model** for reasoning with **Qwen** for output generation via Groq. This combo delivers excellent performance at reasonable cost.

## Quick Setup

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/rinadelph/CursorCustomModels.git`
2. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure: Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and add your API keys
4. Run: `python src/multi_ai_proxy.py`
5. Connect Cursor (see below)

## Cursor Setup (CRITICAL!)

Cursor requires initial verification with a real OpenAI API key:

1. Enter a **real OpenAI key** in Cursor settings
2. Click ""Verify"" - this unlocks Custom API Mode
3. After verification, change ""Base URL"" to:
   - Local: `http://localhost:8000`
   - Remote: Your NGROK URL
4. Click ""Verify"" again to test your proxy
5. Select your model and start using!

## Technical Notes

- Creates a local proxy that intercepts Cursor's OpenAI-bound requests
- Routes requests to your preferred AI provider
- Includes NGROK for remote access if needed
- Streaming responses for real-time interaction
- Proper tool handling for file editing, search, etc.

## Disclaimer

This is a **proof of concept** with **no maintenance guarantees**. Use at your own risk and in accordance with all services' terms of use.

I've been using this setup for months with substantial cost savings compared to subscriptions. Feel free to fork, modify, and improve!

mis7j07,,"Hi, yes a human here, was dumping my whole cursor tool stack on github after what to me is  a greedy cash grab of a product. 

The substantial cost savings is the tool requests. When connecting a custom model to cursor using this, you dont get charged for the 5 cent premium tool requests from 3.7 max. You can also use cursor for free if you run your own local models like Qwen or R1 if you have the hardware. I also use a variation of this and the multiple cursor launcher I released on my github to have a main Composer window that delegates tasks to 4 other composer windows on the same codebase.

By opening up the AI model selection you allow flexibility and control over what you do. Its also very interesting to build on.

For example, I have a custom 3.7 model that I send a context file that is extremely deterministic that covers every single part of my project idea and then properly delegates the tasks to each agent. But you need to have a way for agents to track what other agents are doing, so with this I have a deterministic markdown file detailing the project structure and files and whenever an agent wants to make a file, it has to check that markdown file to see if another agent is currently working on that file. If there is an agent working on that file, it runs an delay command for 10 seconds to see if the other agent has finished. Using these tricks and tools I have significantly increased my productivity and output. I'm giving the fundamentals that I used to create these systems. I cant give out all the sauce lol.

1j56j7i,Found a workaround for Cursor context limit,"I found a really good workaround for this problem everyone has been having, but it takes about an hour of setup.

1. Set up a Google Gemini API key (free)
2. Set up `cursor-tools` (you can find this on GitHub)
3. Follow the installation steps and integrate it into your project (the cursorrules file is important)
4. Every time you give big instructions, at the bottom of the prompt tell Agent to ""ask Gemini to help you plan, and when you are finished, ask it to review your work""
5. `cursor-tools` zips the *entire* repo, uploads it to Gemini (which has a 2 million context token window), and it comes back with very clever analysis and a smart feedback loop for Agent. They kind of start talking to each other which is really cool to watch.

This workflow is generating really good results. I guess a lot of the intelligence problems really are down to the context summarisation.

The other thing I found works well is to ignore the new ""Start a new chat for better results"" message. Starting a new chat seems to lower the IQ of Cursor a lot, so I am sticking to the same chat for a day or two until a feature/project is completed.

Edit: I would recommend only attempting this if you are an experienced developer, because I've had to solve numerous configuration issues over the last 24 hours to get to 100% perfection, and even now it could break at any moment. But it is pretty incredible. My Cursor (v0.46.10) is one shotting very complex tasks again with Claude 3.7 Thinking + Gemini Pro.

Notes:

- 0.5.0, the version you can just npm install right now, only seems to work up to 1 million tokens
- 0.6.0-alpha.7 supports OpenRouter and [you can force it to use the 2 million token model](https://github.com/eastlondoner/cursor-tools/issues/57)
- But the alpha version randomly crashes about 1 in 10 times. You will waste fast requests restoring checkpoint and restarting it, if you care about that.
- Auto setup seems to automatically create the .cursorrules file but it doesn't work all the time, you should create the [.mdc](https://github.com/eastlondoner/cursor-tools/blob/2fbb1dfd5760c4712b98489bd133095225432827/.cursor/rules/cursor-tools.mdc) file instead.
- If you have a complex shell setup with zsh, zshell, nvm etc, cursor-tools might not be available inside the Agent's shell. You will have to debug this yourself.

Then my process is as follows.  I get cursor to work on an issue and once I have tested it and it works (which often involves a back-and-forth as Cursor experiments) I then tell Cursor that I'm going to revert the files back to their original state and that I want Cursor to first describe exactly how to make the changes required for the task in the most surgical manner, after which I will revert the files and then Cursor can proceed to re-implement based on everything it learned.

Then my process is as follows.  I get cursor to work on an issue and once I have tested it and it works (which often involves a back-and-forth as Cursor experiments) I then tell Cursor that I'm going to revert the files back to their original state and that I want Cursor to first describe exactly how to make the changes required for the task in the most surgical manner, after which I will revert the files and then Cursor can proceed to re-implement based on everything it learned.  I actually stash the files instead of reverting them as I don't want to lose that work, but so far the result of this is that it's eliminated all of  the experimental cruft code that Cursor throws in there as we go back and forth refining the code until it works.","I followed this method using a TODO .md file today and it worked SO well. I start out with a prompt where I specify first all of the relevant code files. Then I spell out the scope of the task to be done. Then I add the following at the end of my prompt We need to break this down into parts because there are multiple things we need to accomplish and we should do them one at a time and test them before moving on to the next part. Its critical that all of the changes we make are done in a surgical way, with minimal code changes when possible. We must be very careful not to break or remove existing functionality. Do not introduce any new bugs or syntax errors. Do not make formatting changes to code altering whitespace, switching single quotes for double quote, modifying tabing, etc unless those changes are absolutly essential for the work on this task. The reason we want to avoid making unnecessary formatting changes is because they add a lot of clutter and confusion to the git diff logs. Plan this out by first analyzing each task within the context of the existing code and add your plan and plan steps as checkbox items within the TODO.md file. Then after making your plan, return to those steps in your plan in TODO.md and implement each item and check them off as you do.

mi5tn78,,"Haha, yeah, I mean I hope the Cursor team didn't misconstrue my comment as this has been game changing for me. I have a very minimal coding background and run a decently sized business where my partner is the coder (but he's tied up with other projects). I've been tinkering with AI and it's turned into a full blown mission for me to tie together all the systems with AI, but I never had the knowledge to do it. Within a month or so, I've already eliminated a couple of paid programs that we've been paying for and have streamlined things a ton.

This is honestly like Pandora's box and all the ideas I've had floating around for years, I feel like I can finally accomplish them. It's exciting.

When I first installed 45, it was great, but I ran into the same issue. After about a days worth of work, it would completely freeze and then crash. If I opened up the app again, it would crash within the first question to the bot.

I installed 46 and same thing. Then 47 and I am still getting it.

I've learned to just live with it as when it works, it's super fast and highly accurate (from what I can tell - I've learned the hard way to always check what it's doing). But it is annoying to have to start over with a new bot with zero context bc I have to explain everything all over again, especially some of the complex logic we've implemented into the code.

If there's a positive to this, it's forced me to take great notes and really think through what I'm doing so I don't have to guess with the new bot!

As far as it being something other than cache, it's possible for sure. It just seems to me that the longer it goes on, it slows down and then once I clear the cache (with the same codebase), it works lightning fast.

1j5s73m,What are your top tools besides Cursor?,"What are your top tools in your daily developer workflow besides Cursor? Many tools are emerging right now. While I discard most of them for lacking unique value, some truly stand out. However, with the influx of options, it can be challenging to find the best ones. 

Here are some LLM tools I currently use:  

1. ChatGPT Mac app - primarily because of a team pro subscription.  

2. Repo Prompt - also due to the team pro subscription. However, it will soon shift to a paid plan, and I plan to switch to a free alternative or create my own version by forking PasteMax. I expect some MCP features will be introduced in the ChatGPT Mac app, or we may transition to Claude.  

3. [itsdart.com](http://itsdart.com) \- I have been using it daily since I installed it.  

4. Ollama - for testing models and more.  

5. Several tools from Simon Willison (https://simonwillison.net/) and his blog, which I read daily. I prefer this over getting lost in a flood of YouTube ""content"" creators, as it helps maintain my productivity.  

6. Talktastic as my VTT.  

7. Goose - I'm unsure about it; it's still buggy, and if we switch to Claude, I would likely stick with that.  

8. Aider - I still use it, but less frequently, as Cursor, Roo, Cline, etc., have been equally effective. I find I waste more time switching between tools and catching up on change logs than learning how to maximize one or two tools.  

There are several other tools, but they are not specifically LLM-related.

1jfr0et,Making Cursor x10 Stronger with MCP Servers,"MCP Servers are trending, but it's not always clear how to use them effectively to boost Cursor's productivity.

Here are five key aspects about MCP servers that had the greates impact:

1. Playwright automation for frontend testing - A must-have tool for frontend development. Playwright lets AI run UI tests and validate components, creating a seamless loop between coding and testing that fully automates the process.
2. Browser agent for research and complex tasks - Cursor can perform complex web tasks like checking documentation, conducting research, and testing compex scenarios for services I develop by connecting browser-use as an MCP server.
3. Describe tools with .mdc rules - Adding descriptions of when to use each tool improved AI's decision-making. It now selects the right tool without me having to specify or force Cursor to use a particular option.
4. Dev mode for MCP servers development - Using the SDK dramatically simplifies MCP server development. You can test tools, resources, and see all issues directly from the UI.
5. Use Cursor beyond coding - I now use Cursor as an AI-driven editor for database tasks, GitHub issue tracking, research, and maintaining notebooks - all through MCP server connections.

I've packaged everything I discovered into an interactive tutorial: [https://enlightby.ai/projects/11](https://enlightby.ai/projects/11)

There you'll find a step-by-step guide to setting up MCP servers, learning how to develop and test them, and building your own AI-agentic browser tool right in Cursor. It's completely free.

If you want to try out mcp (model context protocol) with little to no setup:

I built https://skeet.build where anyone can try out mcp for cursor and dev tools.

We did this because of a painpoint I experienced as an engineer having to deal with crummy mcp setup, lack of support where we need it most like Jira and Linear - updating slack and all that friction that engineers hate doing.

Mostly for workflows that I like:

* start a PR with a summary of what I just did
* slack or comment to linear/Jira with a summary of what I pushed
* turn this figma into code
* pull this issue from sentry and fix it
* Find a bug a create a linear issue to fix it
* ⁠pull this linear issue and do a first pass
* pull in this Notion doc with a PRD then create an API reference for it based on this code
* Postgres or MySQL schemas for rapid model development

Everyone seems to go for the hype but ease of use, practical pragmatic developer workflows, and high quality polished mcp servers are what we’re focused on

1j2rgj2,🚀 Just Released: Cursor Rules CLI - Auto-scan your project & install relevant Cursor rules in one command,"Disclaimer: This is a community-driven project not officially associated with Cursor.I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions! Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey r/cursor community!

I'm excited to share a tool I've been working on that makes finding and installing Cursor rules super easy: Cursor Rules CLI.

https://i.redd.it/sk0xovit2jme1.gif

What it does:

* 🔍 Automatically scans your project to detect libraries and frameworks
* 📥 Installs the most relevant Cursor rules directly to your rules folder
* 🎨 Beautiful, intuitive CLI interface
* 🔒 100% privacy-focused (all scanning happens locally)

How it works: Just run cursor-rules in your project directory, and it does all the work for you - no more manual searching or guessing which rules you need!

    pip install cursor-rules
    # Scan your project and install matching rules
    cursor-rules

What makes it special: The rules are created using a  two-step process:

1. Semantic search with Exa to gather best practices
2. LLM enhancement to create structured, optimized content

1j21lo8,Cursor vs Claude Code,"I've tried Claude Code over the last few days on a few Ruby on Rails 7 and 8 codebases that I work on.   
  
It's interesting, and it has a few features that would be good additions to Cursor.   
  
Compared to cursor:

The good:

* Very high code quality. This thing blows Cursor out of the water. I can't believe both use the same model when I see the difference in how Claude-3.7 behaves in Cursor and how it behaves in Claude Code. It's a completely different experience, on the same codebase with the same model. 
* It reports if its context is nearly filled, and allows you to compact it (summarise) or clear it. Great feature that Cursor should have too. 
* No 'can't connect to Anthropic' or 'can't connect to OpenAI' errors.
* Less errors compared to Cursor operating on the same codebase after writing code.
* I've had no functionality breaking mistakes, which do happen every now and then with Cursor, where it just breaks something or large files are truncated. 

The bad:

* It's not an IDE, but a node based terminal application that works on your codebase. That makes it a bit harder to work with (it would be fun to run it on an old VT200 terminal by the way). 
* The price! Working on just a few new features in a Rails app for around 3 hours kost me around $20,- in Claude Code. That's not cheap compared to what I pay for Cursor in a month and definitely something Claude should fix. 
* No MCP servers in Claude Code (at least I haven't been able to figure out how), though I haven't really missed them. Since it's a terminal app, Claude Code can execute all sorts of commands.   
* Cursor on the other hand is much cheaper, but that might also be its downfall. I'm perfectly willing to to pay more for Cursor if the quality it delivers is higher and more consistent.

Here's where I'm at with my 100% [v0.dev](http://v0.dev) rebuild > [guitar.design](http://guitar.design)","I was originally building an app in Cursor using ReactViteShadcnui with a mixture of v0.dev to help prototype the look. A few days ago, I decided to completely rebuild the whole thing in v0. Its going well, not as easy to manually modify files and such as Cursor, but sometimes the output from v0 is way better than what I had in mind. Its nice to have it all in one place now instead of copying and pasting code between the two. Granted, with v0 youre stuck with next.js if thats an issue. To be honest, so far being able to build it in v0 and directly deploy it has been a breeze. I dont immediately have any backend ambitions for my app, so Im not sure how well v0 handles that.

mi17ykz,,"v0 has gotten much better lately in my experience and I still prefer using it for UI over cursor.  
What I personally do is build my UI using v0 first, set some good cursor rules for the project then let cursor take over changing/adding elements.

Following that pattern seems to work for me, I just built my first app doing just that, I won't post a link here to not promote but you can see the UI results are pretty good with some direction. You can also customize your shadcn styles it doesn't really have to all look the same.

Also you can use v0 w/o a sub if you are not in a hurry to build all in one go.

1jgfic0,🚀 The Ultimate Rules Template for CLINE/Cursor/RooCode/Windsurf that Actually Makes AI Remember Everything! (w/ Memory Bank & Software Engineering Best Practices),">[https://github.com/Bhartendu-Kumar/rules\_template](https://github.com/Bhartendu-Kumar/rules_template)

Hey fellow coders! 👋

After months of experimentation and countless hours wrestling with AI agents that kept forgetting context, I think I've cracked it. I've created what I believe is the most comprehensive rules template for CLINE/Roo Code and Cursor/Windsurf that actually makes AI agents retain memory and follow proper software engineering practices.

🤔 The Problem:  
\- AI agents forgetting context between sessions  
\- Inconsistent code quality  
\- No proper software engineering lifecycle adherence  
\- Fragmented memory across Cursor, CLINE, Roo Code, Windsurf

✨ The Solution:  
I built a template that combines:  
\- Memory Bank architecture (persistent context)  
\- Software Engineering lifecycle integration (PRDs, RFCs, etc.)  
\- Custom prompts for reasoning and best practices

🎯 Key Features:

1. \*\*Unbreakable Memory System\*\* - Structured file-based memory with PRD/RFC support - Context retention across sessions - Automatic documentation generation
2. \*\*Software Engineering Integration\*\* - Full SDLC compliance - Built-in best practices enforcement - Automated quality checks
3. \*\*Cross-Platform Synergy\*\* - Works seamlessly with all Cursor, CLINE, Roo Code, Windsurf at once. - Share context between platforms - Unified rule system. \*\* One project Work across Cursor, CLINE, RooCode,Windsurf, etc\*\*: One of the biggest problem that we see today is that we use so many tools, Atleast one out of {Cursor/Windsurf} plus one from {CLINE/RooCode/Copilot Agents} we use. So these rules solves the problem of switchign between teh tools. As the context is through the files in the project, the AI can work across the tools.

📦 Structure:

project/  
├── .cursor/rules/        # Cursor-specific rules  
├── .clinerules/          # CLINE rules & memory  
├── docs/                 # Living documentation  
└── tasks/               # Task management

>🚀 Getting Started:

1. Clone the repo
2. Copy rules to your Cursor/CLINE/Roo Code / Windsurf
3. Start coding with superhuman AI assistance

The template is fully documented and open source. You can find it below or above.

🤝 Looking for Feedback:  
I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences if you try it out. What works? What could be better? Let's make this template even more powerful together!

1jd9g3j,Cursor is AMAZING,"I just finished deploying my first project with cursor. With zero codeine experience (although I did have a two year stent at a couples tech startups as an analyst writing some sql), I built a webapp for my company that automates a manager’s job in two weeks. 

Learned a lot in the process. Previously had been using o1 for coding, but this tool opens up the game in a whole new way. Context window is still a bit of an issue, but if you’re persistent and ask the right questions, you can get all the way there! 

The app I built takes actions on behalf of a user using a third party website — using their undocumented API to send and receive requests. It aggregates order data and automatically prioritizes orders based on our business logic. Then it takes all actions required to build the order in this third party tool and aggregates the labels by order so the user can download all the built product labels.

Next step is to automate the label printing and add a user authentication so I can track employee performance down to the minute.

Absolutely wild what this tool enables ambitious people to accomplish. Can’t speak highly enough of it.

Happy to answer any questions about my workflow. Unfortunately, I can’t share the app rn, because I haven’t built in the security features that would make that possible.

and even if you can’t, it’d be great if you can share about it in your communities so more people can make use of it and save their time while improving their development workflow, just like cursor does for us devs!

mhxrghk,,"I subscribed to both and have been using Claude Code this month as a bake off. They all have their pros and cons. Claude Code is the best quality. Cursor is a better generalist than windsurf, but windsurf does a better job working on smaller scopes that have related dependencies in the project. 

Claude Code also costs me about $10 if I use it for a 3-4 hour session. Cursor, I hit the credit limit in about 10 days and went to slow mode. Windsurf’s flow credits are untenable at this point. For $60 I got 3,000 monthly credits and cheaper packs of more. Each tool call is a credit. 

Sonnet 3.7 does a lot more lot smaller tool calls to learn the real context. People complain, but I’ve found the accuracy improved because of it in an enterprise stack. Claude code does a lot of prompt caching behind the scenes to make the price cheaper.  And a lot of the tool calls are reading like 10 lines, but it’s all the same to windsurf. 

So my 3,000 credits for $60 to codeium if I average say 15 tool calls per prompt would be equal to 200 cursor credits out of the 500 I get for $20/mo. And windsurf doesn’t have a slow credit like system. If you have no flow credits, you get a copilot level functionality. All that ends up making windsurf even more expensive than Claude Code.

If you want to try out mcp (model context protocol) with little to no setup:

We did this because of a painpoint I experienced as an engineer having to deal with crummy mcp setup, lack of support where we need it most like Jira and Linear - updating slack and all that friction that engineers hate doing.

Mostly for workflows that I like:

* start a PR with a summary of what I just did
* slack or comment to linear/Jira with a summary of what I pushed
* pull this issue from sentry and fix it
* Find a bug a create a linear issue to fix it
* ⁠pull this linear issue and do a first pass
* pull in this Notion doc with a PRD then create an API reference for it based on this code
* Postgres or MySQL schemas for rapid model development

1jgkm9z,"🖥️ Loving Cursor AI, But We Need True Multi-File Editing!","Hey everyone,

I've been using Cursor AI for a while now, and honestly, I'm super impressed with how it handles code suggestions, AI-driven edits, and autocomplete. ✨ It’s smooth, intuitive, and genuinely makes coding feel fun! But as much as I love it, there are a few things that are really holding me back—especially when working on full-stack projects.

📝 1. Cursor Needs Smarter Multi-File Editing
One of my biggest struggles is that Cursor doesn’t properly update multiple files when making changes. For example:

✅ If I modify a backend API, Cursor doesn't automatically update the frontend where that API is used.

✅ If I rename a function in one file, Cursor doesn’t update the other files where it’s called.

✅ If I refactor a React component, I have to manually fix related imports and dependencies across different files.

Right now, Cursor feels very ""file-by-file"" focused, but modern projects require ""whole project"" awareness. If it could intelligently detect connections between files and apply changes across them, that would be a game-changer! 🎯

🔗 2. Better Frontend-Backend Awareness

When working on full-stack apps, Cursor doesn’t seem to understand the connection between frontend and backend code. Imagine if it could:

🔄 Recognize when an API route changes and automatically update the frontend fetch calls.

⚡ Detect prop or state changes in a React component and suggest necessary updates in other components.

🛠️ Help with TypeScript type propagation across different layers of the project.

That would save hours of debugging and make it truly feel like an AI-powered coding partner. 🤖

🧠 3. AI That Remembers Context
I’ve noticed that Cursor ""forgets"" things between sessions. If I ask it for a change today and come back tomorrow, it acts like we never talked about it. Persistent AI memory—where it remembers project structure, coding patterns, and past interactions—would make it far more powerful!

🔹 Imagine if Cursor remembered project-specific rules and previously used patterns across sessions.

🔹 It could auto-suggest best practices based on the codebase history.

🔹 A ""project memory"" mode where it remembers ongoing work would be a huge win!

🐞 4. Smarter Debugging & Code Reviews
Cursor is great at suggesting code, but when it comes to debugging and reviewing, I think it could do more, like:

🧐 Explain why a bug is happening instead of just suggesting a fix.

🔍 Offer step-by-step debugging insights instead of just throwing in a patch.

📊 Compare code changes and suggest optimizations based on best practices.

🚀 Final Thoughts

Don’t get me wrong—I love Cursor AI, and it’s easily the best AI-powered code editor I’ve used. But if they improve multi-file editing, frontend-backend awareness, and AI memory, it could become the ultimate coding tool for developers.

mj013as,,"I've seen similar issues while building an Electron app. Similar to backend and frontend, an Electron app have multiple processes (Renderer, Main/Background). There is lot of IPC across these processes. Cursor usually breaks the 'chain of command'. Meaning, it will update process on once side and won't update on the other side. Also because of the IPC model, it also mixed up changes many times. For example, a Renderer will never have access to Filesystem. Anytime they you have change that needs to update FS, it should always be added to Main and an IPC call should be made from Renderer. Cursor many times added changes to Renderer. 

They only way I'm thinking is to make specific extensions that follow idiomatic processes for specific frameworks. Fro example, Cursor for Ruby on Rails, Cursor for NextJS, Cursor for Electron etc., that bakes these 'rules'. I've seen this approach by Jetbrains. They have separate forked editors for Rails, NodeJS, etc.

Also because of the IPC model, it also mixed up changes many times. For example, a Renderer will never have access to Filesystem. Anytime they you have change that needs to update FS, it should always be added to Main and an IPC call should be made from Renderer. Cursor many times added changes to Renderer.

mizyvok,,"Glad to hear Cursor worked well for your project! Sounds like an awesome setup with the Xbox 360 API and dashboard.

I’ve been tweaking my prompts, but when working on AI/ML projects—especially full-stack ones—I’ve noticed some limitations. For example:

When modifying a backend AI model (e.g., TensorFlow/PyTorch API), Cursor doesn’t always update the frontend where the predictions/results are displayed.

If I tweak a preprocessing script or data pipeline, it doesn’t suggest updates in the model training or inference code automatically.

Handling API integration between AI models and the frontend (e.g., showing real-time predictions in a web dashboard) requires manual tracking of changes.

If you want to try out mcp (model context protocol) with little to no setup:

I built https://skeet.build where anyone can try out mcp for cursor and dev tools.

We did this because of a painpoint I experienced as an engineer having to deal with crummy mcp setup, lack of support where we need it most like Jira and Linear - updating slack and all that friction that engineers hate doing.

Mostly for workflows that I like:

* start a PR with a summary of what I just did
* slack or comment to linear/Jira with a summary of what I pushed
* pull this issue from sentry and fix it
* Find a bug a create a linear issue to fix it
* ⁠pull this linear issue and do a first pass
* pull in this Notion doc with a PRD then create an API reference for it based on this code
* Postgres or MySQL schemas for rapid model development

To provide its features, Cursor makes AI requests to our server. This happens for many different reasons. For example, we send AI requests when you ask questions in chat, we send AI requests on every keystroke so that Cursor Tab can make suggestions for you, and we may also send AI requests in the background for building up context or looking for bugs to show you.

An AI request generally includes context such as your recently viewed files, your conversation history, and relevant pieces of code based on language server information. This code data is sent to our infrastructure on AWS, and then to the appropriate language model inference provider (Fireworks/OpenAI/Anthropic/Google). Note that the requests always hit our infrastructure on AWS even if you have configured your own API key for OpenAI in the settings.

We currently do not have the ability to direct-route from the Cursor app to your enterprise deployment of OpenAI/Azure/Anthropic, as our prompt-building happens on our server, and our custom models on Fireworks are critical in providing a good user experience. We do not yet have a self-hosted server deployment option

And likewise, Cursor is an *Anthropic* customer, whose product/service has a critical dependency on Anthropic’s product, which they pay for.

So Cursor should be beating on Anthropic’s door, to get Anthropic to improve their service or increase their service level or whatever.

Ok first, I’m not talking about *suing* anybody. If somebody mentioned that, it wasn’t me. And I don’t think “food poisoning” is really the same thing as “I have to write my own code like a peasant,” although it feels that way.

But second, if the grocery store *white labeled the chocolate bar and sold it as their own* then yeah, they’re the ones I’d talk to first. I think that’s closer to what Cursor does with Anthropic.

To be perfectly honest, I think raising hell with Cursor *and* Anthropic is probably the rational thing to do. Because if Anthropic makes/lets themselves be so openly associated with Cursor, then when that part of Cursor breaks down they should expect some flack.

1j8s1w7,You’re using Cursor rules the wrong way,"I spent too much time fixing AI-generated code. After testing different approaches, I found a way to build rules that actually works.

Here’s what made the biggest difference:

1. Force Cursor in .cursorrules file to follow your .mdc project rules

2. Keep rules simple and focused. Don’t dump everything into one big file

3. Create a new rule whenever AI repeats a mistake

4. Let AI write rules for you. Use meta-rules to automate this

5. Enable visibility rules to see what’s applied in every AI action

To make understanding easier, I built an interactive course where you can try these approaches in Cursor IDE with real examples. Check it out, it’s free: [https://enlightby.ai/#/projects/35](https://enlightby.ai/#/projects/35)

You can also find extension on Visual Studio marketplace: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ai-dl.enlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ai-dl.enlighter)

1j17kgo,Quick Guide: Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP (talk to your database),"**Quick Guide: Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP**

If you're trying to hook up your Supabase database with Cursor (using MCP), here's a quick, straightforward guide. This setup lets you interact directly with your database through natural language—so you can just tell Cursor Composer what you want (like querying data, adding tables, etc.) without fiddling with manual SQL every time.

I struggled for hours last night because I skipped this step at first. Without this, Cursor just couldn't get accurate context from Supabase, even when I fed it the docs directly.

Here's what worked for me:

**Step 1: Get your Supabase connection string**

* Log in at [Supabase]() and pick your project.
* Head over to your project's connection settings.
* You’ll see a connection string there. Replace any placeholder passwords with your actual database password.
* Copy this entire connection string (you'll need it for Cursor).

**Step 2: Add your MCP server in Cursor**

* Open Cursor and navigate to Settings → Features.
* Scroll down past the ""Codebase indexing"" section until you see the MCP servers area.
* Click on **""Add New MCP Server""**.
   * Set type as **Command**.
   * Name it clearly (mine is just ""Supabase - My App"").
   * Paste the connection string you copied from Supabase here.
* Hit save.

**Step 3: Try it out**

* Now you can use Cursor Composer or similar tools to run queries directly against your Supabase database without leaving Cursor.
* Run a quick test (like asking it for a list of tables) to make sure it's connected properly.

Quick tip from experience—make sure you back up your database first. I didn't, and cleaning up mistakes afterwards took ages.

Hope this saves someone else the headache!

* Click on **""Add New MCP Server""**.
   * Set type as **Command**.
   * Name it clearly (mine is just ""Supabase - My App"").
   * Paste the connection string you copied from Supabase here.
* Hit save.

**Step 3: Try it out**

* Now you can use Cursor Composer or similar tools to run queries directly against your Supabase database without leaving Cursor.
* Run a quick test (like asking it for a list of tables) to make sure it's connected properly.

Quick tip from experience—make sure you back up your database first. I didn't, and cleaning up mistakes afterwards took ages.

Hope this saves someone else the headache!

","Quick Guide Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP talk to your database Quick Guide Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP If youre trying to hook up your Supabase database with Cursor using MCP, heres a quick, straightforward guide. This setup lets you interact directly with your database through natural languageso you can just tell Cursor Composer what you want like querying data, adding tables, etc. without fiddling with manual SQL every time. I struggled for hours last night because I skipped this step at first. Without this, Cursor just couldnt get accurate context from Supabase, even when I fed it the docs directly. Heres what worked for me Step 1 Get your Supabase connection string Log in at Supabase and pick your project. Head over to your projects connection settings. Youll see a connection string there. Replace any placeholder passwords with your actual database password. Copy this entire connection string youll need it for Cursor. Step 2 Add your MCP server in Cursor Open Cursor and navigate to Settings Features. Scroll down past the Codebase indexing section until you see the MCP servers area. Click on Add New MCP Server. Set type as Command. Name it clearly mine is just Supabase My App. Paste the connection string you copied from Supabase here. Hit save.

1j6qm58,Cursor DESTROYED MailChimp in 304 words,"Have you ever wanted to send email 'alerts' to your customers?

You probably thought of Mailchimp, or if you're into open source Mautic. Both great options, but I have serious number of different lists to create and aspirations for more.

This is how Cursor wrote a complete, working, fully functional, I mean confirmation double opt in, the alert email template, subscriber list, preference page, subscribe box, the whole lot in ... THREE HUNDRED WORDS of prompting!

Let's back up a bit, a little context

I created [https://pricepergig.com/](https://pricepergig.com/) \- a site to sort, filter, find all the cheapest hard disk drives, SSD and NVMe drives, order by price per GB/TB and now, get instant alerts so you get the cheapest prices.

The problem? Send email alerts to people with the current cheapest HDD, SSD, NVMe drive on their chosen Amazon store for their chosen threshold. e.g. I want amazon co uk hard disks, known brands, where they are less than £13/TB, don't send me anything more expensive than that.

I worked out, with about 8 amazon websites, known brands, unknown brands, HDD, SSD, and NVMe, that a total of 72 different 'lists' on something like Mailchimp (I don't know if it can do variables, Mautic can, but one look at the docs and I'm thinking, but Cursor can just do this).

ANYWAY - I'm a developer with super powers (aka Cursor) so I'll just write my own...

I use my spec document technique, and only 304 words, played on the xbox for 20 mins (I am terrible at Warzone), clicked 'accept' a bunch of times, went to make a cup of tea to review and BOOM, I had 'confirmation' emails AND a fully working 'alert' email. 

It would have taken me longer to make the two email templates alone! This is incredible .

Thanks @ Cursor.  


\# Only if you're interested, here are the prompts #

  
Using my spec document technique, I wrote the spec - and I'm cheating a bit here, I'm not including these words in the word count BECAUSE I'd have to a) write this for a human to implement or b) go read all the docs for mailchimp or mautic and click around for hours figuring it out, so this, imo, is less work than any of those.

    # Goal
    
    We want to send emails to users when they have certain thresholds of listings.
    
    # Features
    
    User's on the front end can subscribe to emails, at that point they choose the options they would like notifications for along with a price per TB or price per GB. threshold to be met.
    When the best price in that category is met, we send an email to the user with the listing details and link directly to the listing.
    
    We will store the users email address and preferences in a table.
    
    We need a front end for the user to manage their email preferences. 
    Users should have to double opt in / confirm their email address for it to become active on the list. 
    
    we should use the same react components for the user preferences as we do on the main site/subscribe component.
    
    we will also need a super simple front end looking component that takes just the user's email address. when a user enters their email address and a threshold price we should send that to the backend and store it in the database, then send the user a confirmation email, once the user confirms their email address we should update the user's status to active on the list. The user can then update their exact preferences.
    
    ## User preferences
    Users can choose from the following options to get notified for:
                ""nvme-m2"" - Cheapest NVMe M.2 SSD (any brand)
                ""nvme-m2-branded"" - Cheapest NVMe M.2 SSD (known branded)
                ""ssd-internal"" - Cheapest Internal SSD (any brand)

                ""hdd-internal"" - Cheapest Internal HDD (any brand)
                ""hdd-internal-branded"" - Cheapest Internal HDD (known branded)
    you will find we already calculate the best price for any item in the database in the pricepergig-backend-webapi/webapi/PPG.Services/BestListingService.cs file. we already have a webhook, we just need to add the logic to call an email service or similar there with the new best listing details - then the new notification service will handle the rest (find users that wanted that notification/threshold etc. and send them an email)
    
    Users can choose their language, but during the signup process we should just default to the currently selected language on the site (set in /ppg/pricepergig-frontend/src/Header.tsx and not need to ask the user this. they can change it on the larger preferences page later if they want to)
    
    
    ## User Interface components/things
    1 - simple sign up form - we get the users email address and the threshold price they want to be notified for.
    2 - confirmation email - we send a confirmation email to the user's email address, once they confirm their email address we update the user's status to active on the list. The user can then update their exact preferences.
    3 - preferences page - the user can update their exact preferences from this page, they can also unsubscribe from the list here.
    4 - unsubscribe link - the user can unsubscribe from the list from this page - but it will just take them to the preferences page.
    
    # Technologies
    
    We will use a hosted SMTP service to send the emails such as SendGrid, but we'll need the smtp details to configure this - they can be configured in the pricepergig-backend-webapi/webapi/EnvironmentVariables.cs file.
    
    We will use hangfire to handle the scheduling of the emails, this way we can 'fire and forget' and not have to keep the application running to send the emails as each time hangfire is started it will resume the emails job from where it left off.# Goal

And, this is my prompts, and if you read, you'll see, a good few prompts were because I had a file called EmailService already that didn't actually do anything other than send me one email each day so I knew the server was up and running.



1. update this file with the single storypoint tasks, make them a check list so that you can follow it later. you should read the codebase and make it clear what you can do - make a good PLAN you can execute later

1. Implement each of the # Single Storypoint Task in thsi file, you shoudl implement them and tick them off as you go. think hard, work methodically. complete the ENTIRE WORKLOAD - keep reminding yourself to look back at this task list and complete it.
2. the migration was created coontinue, you MUST update the Email list document tick boxes as you go

1. continue
2. hey, why don't you try building the back end and fixing the errors
3. try cd pricepergig-backend/webapi dotnet build
4. the problem is u/EmailService.cs and u/EmailService.cs I think the one in the utils folder should be renamed to EmailSenderService
5. ok, now run the new unit tests if you can, we've never done that before in here.
6. you don't need to mock them, just create them and use them and pass them in right? why mock something that dons't need mocking?
7. update this and write some simple instructions for me to test, e.g. i can't even 'see' the subscribe box
8. ok, you've used a new framework for api calls, axios . I think these api calls are simple, just use the native fetch apis go read u/App.tsx as to examples of us using this. now update your email code to use that on the front end so we don't need more libraries.
9. yeah do we need api.pricepergig.com? I don't know what that's about we always use 'baseurl'/api/ instead so can you follow the same, because otherwise that another domain to setup. perhaps you don't know how backened api is, it's just backend.pricepergig.com - api would have been better, but never mind, it's backend.pricepergig.com



I really need to get cursor to not go adding random frameworks, maybe a more complete # Technology section? How do you deal with that?

8. ok, you've used a new framework for api calls, axios . I think these api calls are simple, just use the native fetch apis go read u/App.tsx as to examples of us using this. now update your email code to use that on the front end so we don't need more libraries.
9. yeah do we need api.pricepergig.com? I don't know what that's about we always use 'baseurl'/api/ instead so can you follow the same, because otherwise that another domain to setup. perhaps you don't know how backened api is, it's just backend.pricepergig.com - api would have been better, but never mind, it's backend.pricepergig.com



I really need to get cursor to not go adding random frameworks, maybe a more complete # Technology section? How do you deal with that?





  
","Cursor DESTROYED MailChimp in 304 words Have you ever wanted to send email alerts to your customers? You probably thought of Mailchimp, or if youre into open source Mautic. Both great options, but I have serious number of different lists to create and aspirations for more. This is how Cursor wrote a complete, working, fully functional, I mean confirmation double opt in, the alert email template, subscriber list, preference page, subscribe box, the whole lot in ... THREE HUNDRED WORDS of prompting! Lets back up a bit, a little context I created a site to sort, filter, find all the cheapest hard disk drives, SSD and NVMe drives, order by price per GBTB and now, get instant alerts so you get the cheapest prices. The problem? Send email alerts to people with the current cheapest HDD, SSD, NVMe drive on their chosen Amazon store for their chosen threshold. e.g. I want amazon co uk hard disks, known brands, where they are less than 13TB, dont send me anything more expensive than that. I worked out, with about 8 amazon websites, known brands, unknown brands, HDD, SSD, and NVMe, that a total of 72 different lists on something like Mailchimp I dont know if it can do variables, Mautic can, but one look at the docs and Im thinking, but Cursor can just do this. ANYWAY Im a developer with super powers aka Cursor so Ill just write my own... I use my spec document technique, and only 304 words, played on the xbox for 20 mins I am terrible at Warzone, clicked accept a bunch of times, went to make a cup of tea to review and BOOM, I had confirmation emails AND a fully working alert email. It would have taken me longer to make the two email templates alone! This is incredible . Thanks Cursor. Only if youre interested, here are the prompts Using my spec document technique, I wrote the spec and Im cheating a bit here, Im not including these words in the word count BECAUSE Id have to a write this for a human to implement or b go read all the docs for mailchimp or mautic and click around for hours figuring it out, so this, imo, is less work than any of those. Goal We want to send emails to users when they have certain thresholds of listings. Features Users on the front end can subscribe to emails, at that point they choose the options they would like notifications for along with a price per TB or price per GB. threshold to be met. When the best price in that category is met, we send an email to the user with the listing details and link directly to the listing. We will store the users email address and preferences in a table. We need a front end for the user to manage their email preferences. Users should have to double opt in confirm their email address for it to become active on the list. we should use the same react components for the user preferences as we do on the main sitesubscribe component. we will also need a super simple front end looking component that takes just the users email address. when a user enters their email address and a threshold price we should send that to the backend and store it in the database, then send the user a confirmation email, once the user confirms their email address we should update the users status to active on the list.

And, this is my prompts, and if you read, youll see, a good few prompts were because I had a file called EmailService already that didnt actually do anything other than send me one email each day so I knew the server was up and running. 1. update this file with the single storypoint tasks, make them a check list so that you can follow it later. you should read the codebase and make it clear what you can do make a good PLAN you can execute later 1. Implement each of the Single Storypoint Task in thsi file, you shoudl implement them and tick them off as you go. think hard, work methodically. complete the ENTIRE WORKLOAD keep reminding yourself to look back at this task list and complete it. 2. the migration was created coontinue, you MUST update the Email list document tick boxes as you go 1. continue 2. hey, why dont you try building the back end and fixing the errors 3. try cd pricepergigbackendwebapi dotnet build 4. the problem is uEmailService.cs and uEmailService.cs I think the one in the utils folder should be renamed to EmailSenderService 5. ok, now run the new unit tests if you can, weve never done that before in here. 6. you dont need to mock them, just create them and use them and pass them in right? why mock something that donst need mocking? 7. update this and write some simple instructions for me to test, e.g. i cant even see the subscribe box 8. ok, youve used a new framework for api calls, axios .

1jf2zy9,Proposal: Cursor ULTRA – A Premium Unlimited Tier for Power Users,"---

# Yes, I used **ChatGPT** & **Cursor**'s help to articulate my thoughts better.

---

# TL;DR TL;DR

I propose a new **Cursor ULTRA** subscription tier at a higher price point that offers **unlimited AI usage** without per-request limits or slowdowns. This would be similar to OpenAI’s approach with ChatGPT (where users pay more for unlimited convenience). It addresses the frustration of constantly worrying about hitting limits or extra fees, and it could benefit both power users and Cursor’s business.

---

# TL;DR

I’m suggesting a higher-priced “Cursor ULTRA” subscription that removes per-request limits. Think of it like ChatGPT’s premium plan: you pay more, but you never worry about hitting a quota or getting throttled. This would let power users focus on coding without the mental math of “Is this request worth it?”

**Why It’s Needed:**
- **Eliminates Usage Anxiety**: No more watching the meter or rationing your 500 “fast” requests.
- **Boosts Productivity**: Freely tap into AI assistance—debugging, refactoring, brainstorming—without fear of extra fees.
- **Predictable Costs**: A flat, high-end fee is easier to budget than surprise overage charges.

**Why It’s Profitable:**
- **Similar to ChatGPT’s Model**: People already pay more for convenience and unlimited use.
- **Many Won’t Max Out**: Even with “unlimited,” average usage often stays manageable.
- **Retains Power Users**: Heavier users won’t have to jump ship to cheaper or self-hosted solutions.

A top-tier plan isn’t for everyone, but for those who rely on Cursor heavily, it’s a game-changer: no limits, no friction—just coding with AI on tap.

# The Frustration with Per-Request Pricing

Right now, using Cursor can feel like keeping an eye on a taxi meter. The current Pro plan gives 500 “fast” premium requests per month (with unlimited slower requests after), which is generous for casual use but **very limiting for power users**. If you’re someone who leans heavily on Cursor throughout the workday, 500 requests can vanish quickly. Every time I invoke the AI for help – whether it’s generating a code snippet, debugging, or just brainstorming – **I’m doing mental math**: “Is this request worth one of my 500? Should I save these calls for later?Or should I pay $0.5 for 3.7 Sonnet MAX? Oh but what if I waste that on a tool call that reads the wrong file or some shit like that?” This constant calculation is distracting and pulls me out of my flow.

With a per-request pricing model (beyond the included quota), it gets even more stressful. I find myself holding back from using Cursor’s full capabilities because I don’t want to incur extra charges or hit a wall and get throttled. **Instead of focusing on the code or problem at hand, I’m worrying about usage stats**. That’s the opposite of the seamless coding assistant experience that Cursor is meant to provide. It’s a productivity tool, but the pricing structure is unintentionally introducing friction.

>This chain of thought may not be common to everyone but it surely happens to a few people I know: ""... but what if I waste that on a tool call that reads the wrong file or some shit like that? You know what? I'll create the perfect prompt/rules/other hacky work-arounds for it. Fuck, I can't keep doing this every time. Don't want to keep switching between Agent and chat and edit. why even use edit over agent? fuck it. I'll stick with agent and use the still-intelligent-but-dumber-than-MAX claude. 😔 You know what.. fuck it.

(even if it takes 2-3 minutes - I'll fold my laundry or start using the speech-to-text for the next prompt).""

# Why a High-Cost “Unlimited” Tier Makes Sense

**Some of us are willing to pay a premium for peace of mind**. Look at OpenAI’s ChatGPT model: they offer a flat-rate subscription (ChatGPT Pro at $200/month) for essentially unlimited access, even though heavy users might use far more value than that. People gladly pay for it to avoid the hassles of rate limits or pay-as-you-go bills. The convenience of not having to think about tokens or request counts is worth the extra cost. In my case (and I suspect many others), I’d be willing to pay significantly more than $200/month if it meant I could use Cursor’s AI features without ever hitting a quota or a slowdown. With how quickly I am adding several personal projects to my portfolio and how quickly I am focusing on all the right shit for learning new languages/frameworks/topics - the moment I land a new job with a signing bonus or a contract or whatever else immediately pays for the premium cost of the subscription.

**Enter “Cursor ULTRA”**: an idea for a new top-tier plan. This tier could be priced much higher (for example, $200/month or a lot more - whatever makes sense financially) but comes with **no caps on fast requests** – effectively unlimited usage of premium models at full speed. The goal is to let power users completely remove the “meter” from their minds. No more calculating each prompt or carefully rationing your 500 calls. Just use Cursor as freely as you need to, all month long.

Importantly, this wouldn’t be for everyone – it’s a luxury option for those of us who truly rely on Cursor day in and day out and are ready to invest in that convenience. Many users will stick with the existing Pro plan, which is fine. **But for the segment of users who value unlimited, friction-free usage, this option would be a game-changer**. It’s about giving us a choice: pay more, and in return, never worry about usage again.

# How an Unlimited Tier Improves the User Experience

The most obvious benefit of an unlimited tier is the **psychological freedom** it gives. As a developer, when I’m “in the zone” and using Cursor to assist me, the last thing I want is any speed bump in my thought process. Knowing I have an unlimited plan means I can ask Cursor for help as often as I want – generate tests, refactor code, draft documentation, use the terminal tool, you name it – **without second-guessing every click**. This would let me (and other heavy users) fully embrace Cursor’s capabilities. We could integrate the AI into every part of our workflow, maximizing the value we get out of the product.

In short, **no more breaking our concentration to check how many requests remain** or deciding whether a certain question is “worth it” to ask the AI. This leads to a smoother coding experience and likely better outcomes, since we’re leveraging the assistant continuously. It’s a win for user satisfaction: we feel we’re getting our money’s worth and then some, because the tool is helping us at every step without limits.

Additionally, having an unlimited tier could attract professionals and teams who currently shy away from Cursor because they can’t predict their costs easily. For example, if someone is considering Cursor versus an open-source or local AI solution due to cost concerns, an unlimited flat-rate plan gives them cost certainty. **Predictable pricing** (even if high) can be more appealing than a lower base price with unpredictable overage fees for those who plan to use the tool heavily.

# Why This Can Still Be Profitable for Cursor

I understand that running these AI models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 sonnet thinking max, etc.) isn’t cheap. The current limits exist for a reason – to cover costs. It’s reasonable to worry that an unlimited tier might let a few users consume way more in API usage than they pay in subscription fees. However, here are a few reasons why **Cursor ULTRA could still make business sense** despite that:

• **Many users won’t max it out**: Even among those who pay for ULTRA, not everyone will constantly hit the system 24/7. Usage varies. Some months a user might use a ton of requests; other months less. The high price of the ULTRA tier would be set with this in mind, so that on average, revenue from the subscription exceeds the costs per user. It’s similar to how internet or cell providers offer unlimited data plans – a few people binge on bandwidth, but most don’t use the absolute max constantly, and the pricing still works out overall.

• **Willingness to pay = higher margins**: Users opting for a premium unlimited plan are by definition okay with paying a lot more for convenience. That means higher revenue per user, in general. Even if a handful of users generate a slim margin or even a small loss because they are extreme power users, those will be outliers. **The majority of ULTRA subscribers might only moderately exceed the old limits, resulting in healthy profits per customer** compared to the standard $20 tier. Many people will pay for peace of mind and then not actually use thousands upon thousands of requests every single month.

• **Retaining (and attracting) power users**: If Cursor doesn’t offer an option for heavy usage, the danger is that those users will eventually look for alternatives (like self-hosted models, competitor IDEs, or juggling multiple services to avoid fees). That’s lost revenue and lost community. By offering ULTRA, Cursor can **capture and keep** the highest-value segment of its user base. Even if their individual profit margin is lower, you’re still securing their business (instead of watching them churn out). Plus, having a cadre of expert power users sticking around can lead to more feedback, plugins, and advocacy that benefit the whole community.

• **Premium pricing strengthens the business**: A user paying, say, $200+ a month provides a solid revenue stream that can help Cursor grow and improve. That extra income could fund better infrastructure or model access, which might even reduce costs over time. In effect, ULTRA subscribers are investing in Cursor’s future. It’s recurring revenue from users who are basically saying, “I love this service enough to pay top dollar for it.” That’s a great position for Cursor to be in, even if a few accounts occasionally run at a usage loss.

And let’s not forget: **OpenAI’s own strategy** indicates that this model can work. ChatGPT Pro likely costs OpenAI more to serve some heavy users than the $200 they charge, or even if they might in net loss for now, it’s clearly successful as a product that is bringing the valuation of the company higher. They understand there’s a market for users willing to pay big bucks in exchange for fewer limitations, and have built offerings to cater to that. Cursor can take a page from that playbook, calibrated to its own economics. The key is finding the right price and terms that make the unlimited tier viable without hurting the company’s bottom line.

# Conclusion: A Win-Win for Users and Cursor

To sum up, a “**Cursor ULTRA**” tier would directly tackle the biggest pain point some of us have with Cursor: the mental overhead of limited usage. It would empower developers to use the AI assistant freely and creatively, leading to better focus and productivity. On the flip side, Cursor would tap into a group of customers ready to **pay a premium for this freedom**. Even if a few users push the limits, the overall subscriber base (and the price point of the tier) would provide steady, substantial revenue.

I genuinely believe this could be a *win-win* move. It would keep power users like me happy and loyal, and it would likely boost Cursor’s reputation (and revenue) among professionals.

This leads to a smoother coding experience and likely better outcomes, since were leveraging the assistant continuously. Its a win for user satisfaction we feel were getting our moneys worth and then some, because the tool is helping us at every step without limits. Additionally, having an unlimited tier could attract professionals and teams who currently shy away from Cursor because they cant predict their costs easily. For example, if someone is considering Cursor versus an opensource or local AI solution due to cost concerns, an unlimited flatrate plan gives them cost certainty. Predictable pricing even if high can be more appealing than a lower base price with unpredictable overage fees for those who plan to use the tool heavily. Why This Can Still Be Profitable for Cursor I understand that running these AI models GPT4o, Claude 3.7 sonnet thinking max, etc. isnt cheap. The current limits exist for a reason to cover costs. Its reasonable to worry that an unlimited tier might let a few users consume way more in API usage than they pay in subscription fees. However, here are a few reasons why Cursor ULTRA could still make business sense despite that Many users wont max it out Even among those who pay for ULTRA, not everyone will constantly hit the system 247. Usage varies. Some months a user might use a ton of requests other months less. The high price of the ULTRA tier would be set with this in mind, so that on average, revenue from the subscription exceeds the costs per user. Its similar to how internet or cell providers offer unlimited data plans a few people binge on bandwidth, but most dont use the absolute max constantly, and the pricing still works out overall. Willingness to pay higher margins Users opting for a premium unlimited plan are by definition okay with paying a lot more for convenience. That means higher revenue per user, in general. Even if a handful of users generate a slim margin or even a small loss because they are extreme power users, those will be outliers. The majority of ULTRA subscribers might only moderately exceed the old limits, resulting in healthy profits per customer compared to the standard 20 tier. Many people will pay for peace of mind and then not actually use thousands upon thousands of requests every single month. Retaining and attracting power users If Cursor doesnt offer an option for heavy usage, the danger is that those users will eventually look for alternatives like selfhosted models, competitor IDEs, or juggling multiple services to avoid fees. Thats lost revenue and lost community. By offering ULTRA, Cursor can capture and keep the highestvalue segment of its user base. Even if their individual profit margin is lower, youre still securing their business instead of watching them churn out. Plus, having a cadre of expert power users sticking around can lead to more feedback, plugins, and advocacy that benefit the whole community. Premium pricing strengthens the business A user paying, say, 200 a month provides a solid revenue stream that can help Cursor grow and improve. That extra income could fund better infrastructure or model access, which might even reduce costs over time. In effect, ULTRA subscribers are investing in Cursors future. Its recurring revenue from users who are basically saying, I love this service enough to pay top dollar for it. Thats a great position for Cursor to be in, even if a few accounts occasionally run at a usage loss. And lets not forget OpenAIs own strategy indicates that this model can work. ChatGPT Pro likely costs OpenAI more to serve some heavy users than the 200 they charge, or even if they might in net loss for now, its clearly successful as a product that is bringing the valuation of the company higher. They understand theres a market for users willing to pay big bucks in exchange for fewer limitations, and have built offerings to cater to that. Cursor can take a page from that playbook, calibrated to its own economics. The key is finding the right price and terms that make the unlimited tier viable without hurting the companys bottom line. Conclusion A WinWin for Users and Cursor To sum up, a Cursor ULTRA tier would directly tackle the biggest pain point some of us have with Cursor the mental overhead of limited usage. It would empower developers to use the AI assistant freely and creatively, leading to better focus and productivity. On the flip side, Cursor would tap into a group of customers ready to pay a premium for this freedom. Even if a few users push the limits, the overall subscriber base and the price point of the tier would provide steady, substantial revenue. I genuinely believe this could be a winwin move. It would keep power users like me happy and loyal, and it would likely boost Cursors reputation and revenue among professionals.

1. Ask Cursor to create a shell script at your repo root that copies all repo content to clipboard in LLM-ready format
2. Run the script to get your entire codebase context

1j7wv39,A Deep Dive into Cursor Rules (> 0.45),"# Understanding Cursor Rules Deeply

Hi guys! After diving into Cursor 0.45’s Rules mechanism, I discovered that the official documentation is incomplete. It hints at certain concepts but doesn’t align with our intuition, leading to misunderstandings for beginners. This article provides an in-depth explanation of the Rules system and its principles. Feel free to discuss if you have questions.

# User Rules

User Rules define global preferences, like the desired tone, how the model addresses you, and principles for communication. These rules follow the editor and apply across all projects. User Rules are always sent to the AI in all chat sessions and conversations triggered by pressing Command-K.

# Project Rules

# Purpose

Project Rules are project-specific, designed to align with the needs of individual projects. Cursor organizes them as `.mdc` files in a structured system that automatically creates directories and files when new rules are added.

    └── .cursor
        └── rules
            ├── global.mdc
            └── only-html.mdc

An `.mdc` file is plain text with content that looks like this:

    ---
    description: Always apply in any situation
    globs: 
    alwaysApply: true
    ---
    
    When this rule loads, input: ""Rule loaded: global.mdc.""

# Editing Limitations

Cursor offers an integrated but buggy UI for editing `.mdc` files, which hasn’t been fixed yet. Editing these files with external tools like VSCode is recommended.

# Why Store Them in .cursor/rules/?

1. They integrate into the codebase.
2. Files in `.cursor` can be committed to Git repositories.
3. Teams can collaborate using shared rules, ensuring consistency as everyone pulls the same rules.

# How Do Project Rules Work?

* Do rules placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory automatically activate? **No.**
* Do the same rules apply equally across ask/edit/agent modes? **No.**

# Two Stages of Activation in Cursor

# Stage 1: Injection

Rules are injected into the system prompt context but aren’t yet active. Whether a rule is injected depends on:

1. `alwaysApply` : Injects the rule into the context unconditionally, but **does not control activation** .
2. `globs` : Matches files based on patterns (e.g., filenames, extensions). If matched, the rule is injected into the context. Again, this **does not control activation** .

# Stage 2: Activation

Whether a rule takes effect depends on its `description` field.

Cursor appends the following structure to the system prompt:

    <available_instructions>
    
    Cursor rules are user-provided instructions for the AI to follow to help work with the codebase.
    
    They may or may not be relevant to the task at hand. If they are, use the fetch_rules tool to fetch the full rule.
    
    Some rules may automatically attach to the conversation if the user links a file matching the rule's glob; those won't need to be fetched.
    
    # RULES_1.name: RULES_1.description
    
    # RULES_2.name: RULES_2.description
    
    </available_instructions>
    
    <cursor_rules_context>
    
    Cursor Rules are extra documentation provided by the user to help the AI understand the codebase.
    
    Use them if they seem useful to the user's most recent query, but do not use them if they seem unrelated.
    
    # RULES_1
    
    # RULES_2
    
    </cursor_rules_context>

That's the key prompt `Use them if they seem useful to the user's most recent query, but do not use them if they seem unrelated.`

# Key Points About Activation:

1. `description` : The `description` defines the appropriate scenarios, and the model will evaluate the context to decide whether the rule should be applied., such as:

* Always active in all situations.
* Active during planning discussions.
* Active for frontend projects.
* Etc.

1. **AI Intelligence Required** : The model must have sufficient intelligence to properly interpret the `description`. Less capable models (e.g., GPT-4-mini) may fail to understand and apply the rules effectively.

# Summary

For Project Rules to work as intended, you must understand how these parameters interact:

1. `alwaysApply` : Suitable for global rules.

Hi guys! After diving into Cursor 0.45’s Rules mechanism, I discovered that the official documentation is incomplete. It hints at certain concepts but doesn’t align with our intuition, leading to misunderstandings for beginners. This article provides an in-depth explanation of the Rules system and its principles. Feel free to discuss if you have questions.

# User Rules

User Rules define global preferences, like the desired tone, how the model addresses you, and principles for communication. These rules follow the editor and apply across all projects. User Rules are always sent to the AI in all chat sessions and conversations triggered by pressing Command-K.

# Project Rules

# Purpose

Project Rules are project-specific, designed to align with the needs of individual projects. Cursor organizes them as `.mdc` files in a structured system that automatically creates directories and files when new rules are added.

    └── .cursor
        └── rules
            ├── global.mdc
            └── only-html.mdc

An `.mdc` file is plain text with content that looks like this:

    ---
    description: Always apply in any situation
    globs: 
    alwaysApply: true
    ---
    
    When this rule loads, input: ""Rule loaded: global.mdc.""

# Editing Limitations

Cursor offers an integrated but buggy UI for editing `.mdc` files, which hasn’t been fixed yet. Editing these files with external tools like VSCode is recommended.

# Why Store Them in .cursor/rules/?

1. They integrate into the codebase.
2. Files in `.cursor` can be committed to Git repositories.
3. Teams can collaborate using shared rules, ensuring consistency as everyone pulls the same rules.

# How Do Project Rules Work?

* Do rules placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory automatically activate? **No.**
* Do the same rules apply equally across ask/edit/agent modes? **No.**

# Two Stages of Activation in Cursor

# Stage 1: Injection

Rules are injected into the system prompt context but aren’t yet active. Whether a rule is injected depends on:

1. `alwaysApply` : Injects the rule into the context unconditionally, but **does not control activation** .
2. `globs` : Matches files based on patterns (e.g., filenames, extensions). If matched, the rule is injected into the context. Again, this **does not control activation** .

# Stage 2: Activation

Whether a rule takes effect depends on its `description` field.

Cursor appends the following structure to the system prompt:

    <available_instructions>
    
    Cursor rules are user-provided instructions for the AI to follow to help work with the codebase.
    
    They may or may not be relevant to the task at hand. If they are, use the fetch_rules tool to fetch the full rule.
    
    Some rules may automatically attach to the conversation if the user links a file matching the rule's glob; those won't need to be fetched.
    
    # RULES_1.name: RULES_1.description
    
    # RULES_2.name: RULES_2.description
    
    </available_instructions>
    
    <cursor_rules_context>
    
    Cursor Rules are extra documentation provided by the user to help the AI understand the codebase.
    
    Use them if they seem useful to the user's most recent query, but do not use them if they seem unrelated.
    
    # RULES_1
    
    # RULES_2
    
    </cursor_rules_context>

That's the key prompt `Use them if they seem useful to the user's most recent query, but do not use them if they seem unrelated.`

# Key Points About Activation:

1. `description` : The `description` defines the appropriate scenarios, and the model will evaluate the context to decide whether the rule should be applied., such as:

* Always active in all situations.
* Active during planning discussions.
* Active for frontend projects.
* Etc.

1. **AI Intelligence Required** : The model must have sufficient intelligence to properly interpret the `description`. Less capable models (e.g., GPT-4-mini) may fail to understand and apply the rules effectively.

# Summary

For Project Rules to work as intended, you must understand how these parameters interact:

1. `alwaysApply` : Suitable for global rules.
2. `globs` : Matches files or directories based on naming patterns.
3. `description` : Determines activation during conversations by instructing the model through natural language.

1itwarj,"Reflection of Cursor vs Windsurf. Normally I wouldn’t have tried Windsurf, but…","Guys, I have been switching over from cursor and there's a couple of things that are a little bit annoying me in my workflow:

1) Not being able to simply drag and drop the relevant files from the file tree into the Cascade/Chat.

2) Having no clear distinction of the chat and the cascade, whereas in cursor, I had those two nicely separated. So I had a nice separation of concerns there where I could blast off questions in unrelated topics on the chat side and then do feature buildouts via the composer side. That's something that I'm missing as well.

3) Sometimes when cascades builds something out and when I click to see the code it has written, it doesn't even highlight. So it was very hard to see what exactly changed

4) In cursor, the sidebar is actually sitting on top of the file tree explorer. Is there any way to change it back to the top like it is in cursor?  I feel like that part takes off a significant amount of screen real estate in a sense that it can cut off some file namings and I have to decrease my code view.



What I like about Windsurf:

1) Better clarity on the token usage.

2) The UI looks very clean and nice and the branding is growing on me.

3) Deepseek v3 free

4) minor aspects of the experience that makes you feel that they are much more polising the product, whereas it feels as cursor might be experiencing an increasing level of bureacracy.

5) Better pricing and high usage tier.




The reality of the matter is I wouldn't have even changed to Windsurf if it weren't for the deprecation of adding more fast requests to cursor. I actually only later saw that putting in your own API key would actually be almost the same cost as if it were for paying regular 500 requests, but that wasn't clearly communicated in their user experience (but then why depricate it?)
