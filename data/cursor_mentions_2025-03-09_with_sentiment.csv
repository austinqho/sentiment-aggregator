1j56ju8,I Built a Footnotes Plugin for Summernote – Looking for Feedback!,"Hey r/webdev,

I recently built and published a **Footnotes plugin** for the **Summernote WYSIWYG editor**, and I’d love to get your thoughts on it! 🎉

🔹 **What It Does:**

* Lets you insert **footnotes** at the cursor position.
* Automatically adds them to the end of the editor’s content.

🔹 **Why I Built It:**  
I noticed that Summernote doesn’t have a built-in footnotes feature, and manually handling footnotes can be frustrating, especially for blogs, academic content, or articles. So, I decided to create a plugin to solve this problem.

🔹 **Check it out here:**  
👉 **GitHub:** [https://github.com/ahmadyousefdev/summernote-footnotes](https://github.com/ahmadyousefdev/summernote-footnotes)

I’d really appreciate any **feedback, feature suggestions, or bug reports**! Let me know if this is something you’d use or if you have ideas for improvement. 🚀

Does a calculator make you feel inadequate with its math knowledge and effortless computation speed? The answer to both should be yes. But that's fine, your job isn't to memorize and write the best code, your job is to do your job. Instead of an entry level code monkey, you're now a junior architect who is giving instructions to an ai code monkey, congratulations!

My advice is to get good at reading code and giving feedback. You don't want to let ai make any decisions on its own, that's how you get bad or even dangerous results. It might appear to perfectly understand simple problem domains but when it comes to solving business problems it might make an assumption that is the opposite of what you need or includes a fatal miscalculation. A good way to ensure the ai doesn't make too many decisions is to write or request that it writes stubs/signatures only and then put comments in the function body to precisely guide what it will create.

I shill it so much I feel like I should be paid to do so, but I'd also like to mention windsurf. If your company is already set with a dozen licenses or enterprise setup for cursor then so be it, but I enjoyed windsurf as an alternative for an ai integrated ide that can be instructed to code. I don't know what it does better or worse than cursor, but it's good to know what your options are.

Edit: oops, forgot to answer the question. Why learn? If it's your passion to compete with the calculator then keep practicing and you will get better.

mgpkwka,,"I believe we’re at an inflection point where the contrast between a CS undergrad’s education and the real work world is going to require an overhaul of that curriculum. I was lucky enough to go to a school that was focused on getting into the industry from a non-programming field. 

I’m here with a Data Science education. Instead of learning machine learning from the fundamentals of sigma algebra (ie most DS programs), we learned:

1. ML/Deep Learning techniques
2. Workflows for efficiently deploying and evaluating models
3. Spark/Distributed ETL on data collected for a Fitbit use case
4. Creating an ML-centric application requiring the use of Jira/Github, deployed to the cloud and pitched to venture capitalists.

And a few others that escape me that directly translated to the job. In a perfect world I would have added CI/CD to the list but that’s it.

All to say that while you do need to know how to program to be a programmer, the experience comes from recognizing solutions and implementing them in a sane way. It also comes from getting good at convincing non-technical people that your technical solutions are profitable. Cursor is making it SO much easier to rapidly prototype ideas and get feedback and figure out what works and doesn’t.

How do you know when the LLM makes mistakes? Well it’s when their generated code fails the tests they themselves made based off project specs. 

I’ve gone through exercises where I will encourage juniors to actually come up with questions about their generated code. If you’re hellbent on them learning, why don’t you turn your “I fill your mind’s cup” into reviewing generated code so that you can discuss the common pitfalls.

1ivnr42,I'm a Product Designer who built a Price Comparison platform frontend in 32 hours with Cursor+Claude,"# Introduction

Hey everyone! 👋 I’ve been working on a **comprehensive shopping experienc**e in the form of a **price comparison** platform called [PricePilot](https://trypricepilot.com/)**.**

**It's been designed** to help shoppers discover products efficiently, compare product information side-by-side, and then help compare prices across multiple retailers. As a solo founder, I wanted to share my journey, the challenges I faced, and the tech stack I used.

***BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER:*** *To be transparent as my post is catching the ire of some users, the total time spent on the frontend is at about* ***\~80hrs or so***. The 32 hours I had added in the post title was seeing how fast I could go live with a basic ecommerce frontend which included a search experience, product listings and details page, and full responsiveness.

# Pain Points That Led to PricePilot

Shopping online should be simple, but:

* Finding the best price often means opening multiple tabs and checking different retailers manually.
* Many comparison sites feel outdated, cluttered, or don’t include key product details and features.
* Many platforms prioritize affiliate revenue over a clean UX

I wanted to build something better—**fast, user-friendly, and helpful.**

# How PricePilot Solves These Issues

✅ **Clear, simple UI** and **lightning-fast search** designed for usability  
✅ **Side-by-side product information comparisons** to help you easily compare the differences in price, ratings, and specifications  
✅ **Side-by-side price comparisons** across multiple retailers so you don't have to find the product on each site

*Note: For the moment, we only show US retailers but plan to expand to Canada and perhaps elsewhere once we get everything figured out for the US audience.*

# Tech Stack

💻 **Frontend**: Vercel + Next.js + Typescript + Tailwind CSS + Typesense (Search)  
🛠 **Backend:** Supabase, Python+Playwright+BS4 for web scraping, Node for getting info from APIs and product feeds

# Would Love Your Thoughts!

I’m actively working on improving **search, filtering, and UX optimizations**. Additionally working on getting many more products for you to shop for. If you’re interested in price comparison tools, I’d love your feedback! 🙌

1j4prw6,My (Hopeful) Cursor Redemption Arc.,"This past week, I posted on this subreddit about a silly problem that didn’t really need to be fixed—but I’m glad I did. Turns out the custom cursor trail I spent hours fiddling with, which I thought was the coolest thing about my website, actually sucked. And boy, did you guys not hold back. But I’m so glad I got grilled on my terrible cursor—it was distracting and overall just not great.

I decided to channel this energy into creating something new. So, I completely scrapped the old code and started from scratch. I created two new iterations, trying to incorporate as much of everyone's feedback as possible.

From this link, you’ll find three videos: one of my original cursor effect, one that’s a bit Stronger with the Ink, little darker and more rugged, and another that’s watercolor-inspired with some nice light diffusion. It would mean the world to me if, once again, you all were kind enough to lay into me and tell me what sucks. I tried to take in all the feedback I received, and any pointers would also be amazing!

I currently use Copilot because Cursor feels like it tries to replace too much of how I actually USE my IDE in the first place. Not to toot my own horn but hey, I've been coding since I was 14 and I'm 49. Imagine knowing a foreign language for almost 40 years. You may not be the best in the world at it but you've still outgrown tools like Duolingo.

I don't ""chat"" with Copilot and ask it to write a function for me. It's not even about the code it generates. It just honestly takes me longer to write the prompts in the precise way needed to get the function done the way I would have just written it myself. I work mostly on business-oriented Web and mobile apps, and usually when their logic gets complex it's because there are more rules, not because you're trying to come up with a yet-more-optimal ed25519 curve generator. Time sheets can't be submitted if they don't have start and end times. Oh, also, they can't be submitted if the job code is inactive. Oh, and don't forget, end time must be > start time. Oh and a shift can't be >20h without human approval. Oh yeah, check to be sure it's not a holiday. You get the idea. Just listing all that in a chat session as precisely as you need to do to get the code to be correct - I could have just written it in a few minutes. I didn't need help with that.

The reason I use it at all is because of REFACTORING. Man, Copilot is insanely useful when it comes to that. Pivoting some nested object of consts into an array to feed something like a form-fields-defaults dropdown... I'll get some spreadsheet from Product, paste it into a comment, then just start typing the first entry of the array in the shape I want them all to be. By the time I'm on the second or third, it's figured out what I'm doing and I can just code-complete to get the rest. A small amount of editing, and a tedious task is now just a TAB key to accept it and done. And there are no prompts to adjust it either. If I don't like what it's suggesting, I just keep adjusting my first few entries and eventually it figures out the right pattern.",2025-03-07 13:23:06,16,0,0.0,webdev,CodeAndBiscuits,False,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1j5z69o/which_ide_do_you_use/mgkujqk/,"IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate for me.

Not to toot my own horn but hey, I've been coding since I was 14 and I'm 49. Imagine knowing a foreign language for almost 40 years. You may not be the best in the world at it but you've still outgrown tools like Duolingo.

I don't ""chat"" with Copilot and ask it to write a function for me. It's not even about the code it generates. It just honestly takes me longer to write the prompts in the precise way needed to get the function done the way I would have just written it myself. I work mostly on business-oriented Web and mobile apps, and usually when their logic gets complex it's because there are more rules, not because you're trying to come up with a yet-more-optimal ed25519 curve generator. Time sheets can't be submitted if they don't have start and end times. Oh, also, they can't be submitted if the job code is inactive. Oh, and don't forget, end time must be > start time. Oh and a shift can't be >20h without human approval. Oh yeah, check to be sure it's not a holiday. You get the idea. Just listing all that in a chat session as precisely as you need to do to get the code to be correct - I could have just written it in a few minutes. I didn't need help with that.

The reason I use it at all is because of REFACTORING. Man, Copilot is insanely useful when it comes to that. Pivoting some nested object of consts into an array to feed something like a form-fields-defaults dropdown... I'll get some spreadsheet from Product, paste it into a comment, then just start typing the first entry of the array in the shape I want them all to be. By the time I'm on the second or third, it's figured out what I'm doing and I can just code-complete to get the rest. A small amount of editing, and a tedious task is now just a TAB key to accept it and done. And there are no prompts to adjust it either. If I don't like what it's suggesting, I just keep adjusting my first few entries and eventually it figures out the right pattern.","IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate for me.

So far I've tried (these are subjective):

\* Github Copilot - autocomplete on steroids, only sees the currently open file

\* ChatGPT/Claude/Deepseek web ui - only knows what you tell it

\* Supermaven - like Copilot, but faster I guess

\* cursor - it's pretty much a ChatGPT wrapper in an app. For example, it's asking me questions like \`What framework/technology are you using? (React, Vue, plain HTML, etc.)\` when it has the entire project open and it should be able to know everything about it

\* replit - this is the closest one to the one that I'm looking for, but I couldn't get my project to run in the webview and while I love how it creates new files when appropriate, I would still prefer to have it in my IDE

\* Supermaven - like Copilot, but faster I guess

\* cursor - it's pretty much a ChatGPT wrapper in an app. For example, it's asking me questions like \`What framework/technology are you using? (React, Vue, plain HTML, etc.)\` when it has the entire project open and it should be able to know everything about it

\* replit - this is the closest one to the one that I'm looking for, but I couldn't get my project to run in the webview and while I love how it creates new files when appropriate, I would still prefer to have it in my IDE

","Is there an AI tool that integrates with IDE and takes into account the entire project folder? Hi. Im looking for something to plug into Intellij PHPStorm where I would be able to talk to it like I do with ChatGPT to suggest changes to the currently open project.

1) scrolling being messy  
2) Lack of Nav bar which made it frustrating  
3) too much animation hence unusable  
4) broken subdomains

## Things to considerate:
1. Both the index.html and store.html links only script.js

2. opening the store.html and refreshing it 2-3 times gives this console error:
```txt
Error: Error fetching data: 
TypeError {}
message: ""Failed to fetch""
stack: ""TypeError: Failed to fetch↵ at window.fetch (http://localhost:8158/mguxb9xw_console.js:8:221620)↵ at fetchData (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:13:28)↵ at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:21:9)↵ at http://localhost:8158/script.js:4:1""
get stack: ƒ ()
set stack: ƒ ()
[[Prototype]]: Object
```
3. Open store.html and adding items in store.html and when I refresh the page 2-3 times it gives this error: and I cant add any items after that
```txt
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')

at renderCartItems (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:47:16)
at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:22:3)
```
4. Clearing the localStorage and trying does not solve any problem

5. I threw both my code and errors at AI tools for help, but instead of fixing the bug, we both ended up more confused—now it feels like the AI is debugging me!

",2025-03-06 04:39:20,0,5,0.33,webdev,koko-hranghlu,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1j4ujan/i_have_problems_working_with_asyncawait_and_local/,"I have problems working with async/await and local json file. I have been debugging and smashing my head on table for the past 24 hours! ## My folder structure:

## Things to considerate:
1. Both the index.html and store.html links only script.js

2. opening the store.html and refreshing it 2-3 times gives this console error:
```txt
Error: Error fetching data: 
TypeError {}
message: ""Failed to fetch""
stack: ""TypeError: Failed to fetch↵ at window.fetch (http://localhost:8158/mguxb9xw_console.js:8:221620)↵ at fetchData (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:13:28)↵ at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:21:9)↵ at http://localhost:8158/script.js:4:1""
get stack: ƒ ()
set stack: ƒ ()
[[Prototype]]: Object
```
3. Open store.html and adding items in store.html and when I refresh the page 2-3 times it gives this error: and I cant add any items after that
```txt
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
at http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:55:25
at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
at renderCartItems (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:47:16)
at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:22:3)
```
4. Clearing the localStorage and trying does not solve any problem

5. I threw both my code and errors at AI tools for help, but instead of fixing the bug, we both ended up more confused—now it feels like the AI is debugging me!

1j6d84j,Best AI for Programming (2025-03),"Hey all, I've been using free-tier AI tools pretty intensively over the past few months to support my work and daily life. About 70% of my usage is for programming, and the rest is for other stuff. I’ve been jumping between tools like ChatGPT, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Deepseek—mostly because one of them is usually down or hits its limit when I need it.

Recently, I discovered Lovable dev (along with similar options like Bolt and v0) and gave it a try—pretty impressive stuff 😅. Now I'm feeling a bit stuck on which one is really worth upgrading to a paid subscription.

Any thoughts or suggestions? Also, if anyone’s got a setup that mixes two or more free AIs or even self-hosting options (whether on your own hardware or a rented server), I'm all ears.

For context, I'm a fullstack developer.

Recently, I discovered Lovable dev (along with similar options like Bolt and v0) and gave it a try—pretty impressive stuff 😅. Now I'm feeling a bit stuck on which one is really worth upgrading to a paid subscription.

Any thoughts or suggestions? Also, if anyone’s got a setup that mixes two or more free AIs or even self-hosting options (whether on your own hardware or a rented server), I'm all ears.

For context, I'm a fullstack developer.

1ini225,AI Usage in IDE's,"I'm sure this has been beaten to death, but let's give it another go.

I use several IDE's and one thing they all share is a thriving AI ecosystem. From JetBrains to VSCode the drive to AI is hard to ignore. That  VSCode-->Copilot-->GitHub workflow is really something and keeps getting better.

Codeium, Cursor and such only make it easier and as open source models emerge and costs come down it's only going to get more common.

Being able to say, ""Using DDEV, create a directory, make a database and clone this repo into it then run the install script "" and have it all work is freakin' magic. Telling my editor to make a change, say to rename something, throughout my entire codebase is trivial and I can say it in plain English.

1ird6g1,Experiencing Algorithms Skill Issues and Not Sure How To Get Good,"Please let me know if there is a diff subreddit I should post this in!

First things first: I am in my first intro to algos class and after looking at my grades... I am doomed. I am fundamentally missing something and cannot figure out for the life of me why I am so pathetically bad at this.

For one, I have like a decent amount of experience programming; I've done a handful of beginner projects, and generally feel like I can explain fundamental concepts (abstraction/classes/etc) decently enough, but when I go to code this intense sense of dread and stupidity washes over me and I feel immense pain, frustration, and self hatred every time I do it.

Now, in this course, this sense of frustration and impatience has just officially hit its peak. I am missing pretty much every deadline because I procrastinate so much, and when I do hit the deadlines, I either don't recurse enough times in something or I am using dynamic arrays when they want me to use static arrays, etc. and I am just losing it. While I understand procrastination does not help, there is nothing I would rather avoid than doing a CS project while in the midst of my other more interesting EE-focused classes, and I also just like. Hate it.

One great example is this palindrome detector I'm trying to build. I know in and out how this problem should go, the whole vector of vectors structure I want to use, what my recursive functions are going to do, what their base cases should be, what helper functions I need, what edge cases I want to check for, and yet here I sit, gazing on my VSCode terminal with a completely blank .cpp file and my cursor blinking at me menacingly. Like everything is there in my head but actually putting it down I have so many things I need to start I don't even know where to begin.

In the past, I've tried writing pseudocode, and that helps a little, but I always end up with a pile of awful horrible bugs that make me feel incredibly discouraged, and I've tried starting with smaller functions, but I always find myself going back and forth from unit tests and getting so caught up in writing test cases that the actual code part itself is the last thing I want to do when I've adequately created 1-2 working functions.

It also hurts that in lecture, etc a lot of these concepts download pretty quickly and feel digestible. I really like conceptually concocting solutions to problems and feel comfortable explaining and figuring out where specific data structures are most optimal. Not a single \*written\* assignment has been difficult for me, it is literally just programming.

Now that I'm done whining, here come the questions: how do I overcome this skill issue? Is there a particular resource that will help me build my programming muscle, and if so, is that what is fundamentally missing here? I've heard LeetCode is pretty good, but nobody I talk to can really speak to its value as they haven't really needed it (they just good like that I guess). I'm considering trying it out because in other problem-solving/design-oriented classes, I largely benefit from doing a massive volume of practice problems, but if there is a resource that is better, I would love some insight.

First things first: I am in my first intro to algos class and after looking at my grades... I am doomed. I am fundamentally missing something and cannot figure out for the life of me why I am so pathetically bad at this.

For one, I have like a decent amount of experience programming; I've done a handful of beginner projects, and generally feel like I can explain fundamental concepts (abstraction/classes/etc) decently enough, but when I go to code this intense sense of dread and stupidity washes over me and I feel immense pain, frustration, and self hatred every time I do it.

Now, in this course, this sense of frustration and impatience has just officially hit its peak. I am missing pretty much every deadline because I procrastinate so much, and when I do hit the deadlines, I either don't recurse enough times in something or I am using dynamic arrays when they want me to use static arrays, etc. and I am just losing it. While I understand procrastination does not help, there is nothing I would rather avoid than doing a CS project while in the midst of my other more interesting EE-focused classes, and I also just like. Hate it.

One great example is this palindrome detector I'm trying to build. I know in and out how this problem should go, the whole vector of vectors structure I want to use, what my recursive functions are going to do, what their base cases should be, what helper functions I need, what edge cases I want to check for, and yet here I sit, gazing on my VSCode terminal with a completely blank .cpp file and my cursor blinking at me menacingly. Like everything is there in my head but actually putting it down I have so many things I need to start I don't even know where to begin.

In the past, I've tried writing pseudocode, and that helps a little, but I always end up with a pile of awful horrible bugs that make me feel incredibly discouraged, and I've tried starting with smaller functions, but I always find myself going back and forth from unit tests and getting so caught up in writing test cases that the actual code part itself is the last thing I want to do when I've adequately created 1-2 working functions.

It also hurts that in lecture, etc a lot of these concepts download pretty quickly and feel digestible. I really like conceptually concocting solutions to problems and feel comfortable explaining and figuring out where specific data structures are most optimal. Not a single \*written\* assignment has been difficult for me, it is literally just programming.

Now that I'm done whining, here come the questions: how do I overcome this skill issue? Is there a particular resource that will help me build my programming muscle, and if so, is that what is fundamentally missing here? I've heard LeetCode is pretty good, but nobody I talk to can really speak to its value as they haven't really needed it (they just good like that I guess). I'm considering trying it out because in other problem-solving/design-oriented classes, I largely benefit from doing a massive volume of practice problems, but if there is a resource that is better, I would love some insight. Additionally, how do I avoid the testing trap where I find myself just focusing on writing test cases and neglect the actual progress I'm trying to make?

1j7c5qa,Software engineer who is bad at planning,"I’m a software engineer who is bad at planning. 

Ways in which this affects me:
- Writing design docs bores me. I would rather prototype and learn as I do. Though I do see benefit of designing to ensure requirements are clear, evaluate trade-offs, and prevent wasted efforts / inefficient solutions. I see the benefit. I just don’t enjoy writing them as much. I like to do. 
- It’s difficult for me to estimate the ETA of a task. I’d rather just work on two important tasks in parallel and try to finish both as quickly as possible. When I am blocked on one, I work on the other. 
- And I’m worried that Cursor/Copilot AI is going to automate me, and I don’t really have any career plan here when that happens. 


Can anyone relate? Does anyone have any advice?

Currently I just try to work with good planners and shower them with a lot of appreciation (though let’s be real, good planners are already highly rewarded in every workplace and industry).

I'm supposed to make a game in windows forms and I chose a top down shooter. I created a script to rotate a weapon around the player depending on where the mouse cursor is but now I need to rotate the weapon around itself so it always faces the curser.

1ikrf38,Want to Build things Combining Code with No-Code,"Hey,

 i want to build things like Custom AI Solutions for Customers or a AI SaaS (not here to grab quick cash, just really like it).
I started learning Basics of Python (Brilliant.org Course) which taught me in some way the way to think to Code. I then started doing Automations as Projects using No Code / Low Code Platforms like [v0.dev](http://v0.dev), [Make.com](http://Make.com), Airtable and Cursor AI which i have gotten quite good at using and building sufficient Automations, because i can understand really basic code and what is trying to do. But, as you might have guessed, No Code really has its limitations and i am willing to learn.   

Maybe you guys have good ideas what Languages to learn (I was thinking about React or Node.Js or Something) to use and combine No Code Solutions to get the most leverage out of my work.  

And good ressources to do so. I am willing to pay for resources as long as they are efficient. I dont like Reading all the time, but i also dont like just watching a video, i like interactive/intuitiv explanations (Like [Brilliant.org](http://Brilliant.org) but with the Languages i want to learn)

1ize0ag,Best free alternative of Cursor in VSC with local setup with LM Studio,"Hi,

I would like your opinion on which tool to use to replace Cursor. I like how Cursor works, but I don't want to pay to access all the available features. I have a PC on which I run LM Studio with a Deepseek or Qwen model and I would like to use this instead of the online models via API, so I don't pay for the use because I run it locally. 

I would like to use VSC with some plugin that can connect to my machine with LM Studio and that can replicate the same functions as Cursor. For the functions I would like to have both the suggestions and the autocompletion, but above all the Composer (that function that allows me to create things from scratch starting from a description given in the chat).

Basically, I would like all the Cursor functions, only through free plugins in VSC. Is this possible?

1imxyz2,Internal debate on using AI while coding,"This is not a question as much as its a prompt to hear how others have experienced the transition between coding #raw into coding with an assistant, such as Cursor IDE or Github Copilot

I am 1 year 3 months into working in industry as a frontend engineer, coding mostly with Tanstack/React.

I told myself I needed to work 1 year full time before downloading an AI assistant to give myself a solid foundation. As mentioned, that period was up 3 months ago, when I downloaded Cursor and have been using it since. (A flawed idea? probably)

I have undeniably realized some pretty noticeable productivity gains in development, both in code quality and speed. That said, I can feeeeel myself becoming an idiot. Things I would usually have had to dig into have become a prompt and accept with quick review. Not to mention, I can design an entire system using a concept that I only kind of understand, if I was to switch to a normal editor or try to explain it to a coworker, I will not be able to do it at nearly the depth that maybe I should? It feels wrong but the question remains in my mind as this. 

Do I:

**A) Revert to not using AI, slowly progressing at the risk of not leveraging the 2025 toolset that is increasingly geared towards AI, but really understand what tf I am doing.**

  
or

  
**B) Trust that AI code assistants are not going anywhere and lean into using it becoming a faster and more immediately effective.**   
  
Every once in a while I will get stuck on a problem, furiously prompting, like an addict just begging my computer to spit out the correct answer, which ultimately is such a less gratifying experience than struggling through it on my own. 

I know the answer to this question is ""depends on your goals"" or ""usage within reason is the answer"". 

But in general: @ people who have been coding with AI for longer than 3 months - do you consider yourself a more capable engineer? Are you often caught up with below surface level problems? Have you reverted back to a normal IDE and found many of the skills transfer, or is it really you now cannot code at nearly the same level without the assistant?

This may last a long time because any work beyond the model is just the glue, which is the same for all the AI editors. But In the other side, the auto completion may matters for most of the coders and can be totally controlled by the editor, which should be considered as important as the agent","{'neg': 0.142, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': -0.9487}",-0.9487,"{'polarity': 0.03137755102040817, 'subjectivity': 0.4574829931972789}",0.03137755102040817,0.4574829931972789,Negative,-0.9487

After weeks of wanting to break my computer when Cursor kept breaking my code, I finally snapped and built something.

**The frustration we all know:**

* Explaining your project structure over and over and OVER again
* AI forgetting which libraries you're using after 3 messages
* Getting suggestions that completely ignore your architecture
* That sinking feeling when you realize the ""helpful"" AI just created 47 new bugs

**What I built:** A Cursor extension that creates and maintains a ""project brain"" - it's like giving AI a permanent memory of your codebase's context, architecture, and dev rules.

It works by:

* Creating a detailed spec file of your project's architecture decisions
* Maintaining awareness of file relationships and dependencies
* Actually understanding your tech stack choices (not just guessing)
* Auto-updating as your codebase evolves

**Early users report:**

* AI suggestions that actually make sense for their projects
* No more repeatedly explaining project structure
* Massive reduction in ""AI broke my code"" incidents

mg3zkjy,,"This is like creating md files, with specific instructions  
For Example,  
You create [ProjectStructure.md](http://ProjectStructure.md) , [Objectives.md](http://Objectives.md), [Guidelines.md](http://Guidelines.md), [Coding.md](http://Coding.md), [Frontend.md](http://Frontend.md), [backend.md](http://backend.md), [check.md](http://check.md)

You will mainly use [check.md](http://check.md)  
in there  
""ALWAYS"" means -> checking each content of every md file in detail without missing out any content

then say   
Always check  [ProjectStructure.md](http://ProjectStructure.md) , before creating any new file, and also update it before implementing the last file during composing.

Always use [Frontend.md](http://Frontend.md), if you are creating and detected editing a front end file.

Always use, check, and update [Objectives.md](http://Objectives.md) once implementing current and the next steps.  
........  
and this goes on ...............  
  
the good thing about this, is that you could create your own custom instructions based on the project, once you already used this once in the project, although it might not work at first, but you could improve it based on your own requirements  
  
for example, i had [Error.md](http://Error.md) file, i told cursor to always add linter errors, or any other errors that i paste for it solve in the  [Error.md](http://Error.md) file and how it solved it, it did not automatically add until i had to mention about it, or you could even write a run a script, for this.

I think memory is already there, its just based on instructions to add to train in more based on a user's requirement, because other's do not even need rules because of the way the do the prompting, which is very important, the way you word it makes a big difference, not just normal English.

Maybe you could create an Extension to install in Cursor about logging and learning from this Errors, like whatever the project you could use that log  
for example it would usually   
\-sometimes install uncompatible dependencies.  
\-keep { } in import statements that do not need.  
\-Typescript coding style errors,

So you could accumulate this, tell cursor to always check this log before implementing files, so that it could learn, I am sure this will reduce the struggles. 

Maybe another once would implementation style  
For example  
\-It implements modules that have not been installed yet, whereby it should first install all necessary modules then implement the files  
  
\-sometimes it suggests to use a library but that library does not support certain implementation style or variable, which causes alot of errors, whereby it should first check the requirement of your project, then check a library to is flexible supports our implementation requirements. 

Although some might argue that they still create completed projects without any of the above, but it would still better for a user to have there personal memory that there own cursor could use during implementations.  
  
  
Maybe there might be someone has created, but i dont think if its 100% functional meaning that cursor always uses and follows it during the implementations, i think some it might be there but cursor does not fetch it sometimes, and just goes based on its own LLM implementations, And we cant force it follow the memory but use, learn then implement, which should be done.",2025-03-04 23:12:41,4,0,0.0,cursor,[deleted],False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j3v1zi/i_built_a_cursor_extension_that_actually/mg3zkjy/,"This is like creating md files, with specific instructions

      - Find and offer to use already existing(and recently maintained) git repos that solve problems we are currently working on.
      - never use cocoapods or carthage.  Only SPM, or just extract the relevant files/classes/etc.
      - for SPM always use compatible Exact git versions.
      - Make sure that components work together with expected ins/outs
      - When creating a models for parsing json, look up the api response or sample code or the sdk documentation directly, and use that as a reference, do not guess.
      - Before creating a class or a file, perform a search on the codebase, and check the memlog/directory_tree for any previous implementations and utilize those.  Never create unnecessary duplicate files.
    - Validate all the tests and the builds to ensure correctness.  All targets must pass.
    - Never open or interact with the xcode GUI.  Only use command line interface. 
    - Do not require user feedback for executing work already included in tasks.md, just execut the steps.

*Creates a .cursorrules file containing your project's architecture decisions*



*Auto-updates as your codebase evolves*



*Maintains awareness of file relationships and dependencies*



*Understands your tech stack choices and coding patterns*



*Integrates with git to track meaningful changes*

It’s way too eager, constantly trying to do stuff in the code even when you don’t ask it to.

It also ignores rules - like if you say DRY, KISS, and YAGNI, it still keeps overthinking.

**New Features**

* **Chat/Composer Unification:** We heard your feedback and have unified Chat, Composer and Agent into a single interface. Switch between modes as your needs change with each task during your session.
* **UI Glow Up:** Our new unified chat interface includes several design improvements to de-clutter the UI and improve your flow. Three new themes designed for the Cursor UI are now available. To select a theme, go to Settings > Theme > Color Theme in the Cursor menu.
* **Agent Web Access:** Agent now proactively searches the web to find information when needed without having to include \`@web\` in your prompts.
* **Secure .cursorignore:** New security rules ensure that files listed in .cursorignore are never shared with LLMs or seen by Cursor. The new .cursorindexignore file supports the previous ignore functionality that only limits files from indexing.
* **Agent Tool Limit:** When reaching the 25 tool call limit, the Agent now displays a button to continue beyond this limit with a single click. Bypassing the limit consumes an extra request.
* **New MCP Features:** MCP gains new features like Yolo mode, the ability to configure Project Servers with .cursor/mcp.json, and the ability for Agent to use MCP resources as context.
* **Improved Project Rules:** A visual indicator is now shown anytime a rules set is applied to a request, and rules can now be applied globally.
* **Claude 3.7 Sonnet:** Support for our newest Premium models from Anthropic, Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking - both enabled for Agent.

**Fixes**

* **Crash Fixes:** Several memory, performance and reliability improvements.
* **MCP Fixes**: Reliability and quality of life fixes to make building MCP servers in Cursor even better.
* **Windows Fixes**: 
   * Fixed newline error in Chat Codeblocks
   * Resolve issue with Cursor uninstalling itself",2025-02-24 11:14:06,260,126,0.99,cursor,NickCursor,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1ixa7r3/introducing_cursor_046/,"Introducing Cursor 0.46! This week we’re unveiling our latest major release, Cursor 0.46!

mcqh1oa,,"As your codebase grows larger, it helps to change the way you guide the model. If you continue to interact with it as you did when working on simple tasks or tiny codebases, you may have disappointing results.

I find that for more complex codebases, it really helps to have an indexed requirements directory with files that you can reference when talking with the model. These can be higher-level specs that explain the different sections of the codebase, Mermaid diagrams that visualize flows/states/relationships, and requirements docs for specific aspects of the code. I continue to add these requirements docs when I find the model needs more guidance. For example, if the model is inconsistent with the way it implements a feature in different parts of the code, I'll ask it to create a requirements doc with rules for the feature. Then, any time it's updating code related to the feature, I'll reference the doc and ask that it ensures all updates comply with the doc's rules.

You should also build up rules for the model in ""Rules for AI"" (used on all Cursor projects) and ""Project Rules"" (used for a specific project and can be targeted to specific directories or files). I find the best way to write these rules is incrementally as you find the model getting confused or making mistakes.

Comments in the code can also help the model better understand how each file relates to the codebase as a whole.

I only let it do actual structural work in three cases 1. A blank file. Its quite competent at figuring out what boilerplate to spit out. 2. CSS and HTML when in the same context or same file. Its quite good at designing new elements with their corresponding css. Its better than me at fromscratch css Im better at refinement. 3. OpenGL code. It has a quite good understanding of openGL and can produce solutions that would take me 1530 mins of research to get, plus possibly trial and error and a lot of googling. Outside of those cases, it is not a substitute for my brain. It just lets me type fewer characters to create the same program. Occasionally it outputs code using some language feature or standard library function that I wasnt familiar with, which is a nice bonus. Now, I dont know if 20month is a fair price for that.

I want to say: I feel you OP, been there a lot.

Indeed, most comments mention useful tactics / workarounds.

At the end of the day I think understanding the code matters the most.  
We're not yet at a stage where you can blindly trust the AI and let it do its thing.  
You have to verify the code written by the AI, thoroughly test it, and go small increment by small increment.

So it's a great productivity tool (lets you do faster what you already know how to do), but I wouldn't use it to substitute for what I don't know, from my experience this gets you lost pretty fast and ends up being counterproductive.

We shouldn't forget we are at the forefront of this revolution, messing around with these tools and pushing them to their max.

After wasting all my trial prompts pairdebugging with the IDE I realized I need to actually learn TypeScript so I can find the bugs myself and use Cursor for the things that matter, and even then make sure to keep a close eye on it. Started using the tool expecting to be afraid of my incoming obsolescence as a coder, realized its just a really cool and powerful tool to boost my productivity as a coder.","{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.84, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.8869}",0.8869,"{'polarity': 0.1095959595959596, 'subjectivity': 0.5437149270482604}",0.1095959595959596,0.5437149270482604,Positive,0.8869

mcryua7,,"No, you're wrong. Cursor is dumb, and furthermore, the biggest issue is that it gets dumber, LLMS are kown to get dumber overtime because the average user also gets dumber.

it's still better than the alternatives and it's still a very powerful tool, but it does get dumber overtime, and it does make dumb mistakes all the time.

there also seem to be a few bugs that affect it from time to time, i've had situations where it makes mistakes on very basic and dumb things, like it can't even identify a square or even read my code sometimes.

in my experience Cursor was a lot smarter a few months ago, it made less of these buggy mistakes and the code was just generally better and it also had a lot less mistakes when reading my code. i could tell it read this code and code X by imitating it and it would do it just fine. now i have to start a new chat after changing my code because despite sending new code, it gets hung up on the previous one.  clearly it's getting a lot more lazy, this can be either because it's getting dumber or because they're trying to save money, either way, it's worse.

that last part in particular is very noticeable and is very recent. a few months ago it never struggled with this, but now i can give it some code and it responds, then i change something about the code and it will not register these changes, even if i specifically tell it that i've changed the code and it should reanalyze it, it still won't do it sometimes. this kind of lazyness for not fully analyzing the new code is very annoying and it wasnt there before, i remember something similar to this was happening with ChatGPT 3.5 right before 4o came out.",2025-02-14 10:59:36,-1,0,0.0,cursor,TheNasky1,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1ipcejv/cursor_is_so_dumb_no_youre_the_problem/mcryua7/,"No, you're wrong.

What the fuck are you people even talking about right now. 3 months ago i could ask cursor to copy the code of X component and then do Z component based on that. it would work fine, furthermore, i could then do changes to Z component and tell it to based on that fix some other thing, it had no problem.

now it struggles to imitate X on Z and when i do changes to Z and tell it to based on those changes add something else, it goes back to its own version of Z disregarding the changes i just made.

this is clear degradation in the quality of the responses. it's not some ""projects grow"" bullshit because it happens with all projects, like I said, it happens on new and small projects as well as in big and complex projects.

you can twist it around as much as you like, the only truth is that cursor right now is much worse than it was 3 months ago.

the reason why the quality of the responses went down, is that the team at cursor constantly push updates that mess with the composer degrading the quality of the responses, i don't know if they do it unconciously or if they do it to cut costs, but it's obvious that the quality of the responses went down, i've been using cursor for 6+ months, it's not hard to notice that the quality is going down, specially because every week we get new quirks and shit we have to play around.

2 weeks ago it was slow responses taking 5+ minutes, now it's cursor being incapable of adapting to code changes which is maddening tbh. how is it possible that it ignores changes you do to your code?

to give you a clear example, i have a button, classname=""p-3 m-2"" i tell cursor to increase the margin, it outputs classname=""p-3 m-4"", fine, then i decide 4 was too much so i lower it to 3. i then ask it to do something else and it corrects the margin back to 4 even though i just gave it the new code that had the m-3. this was not an issue a few weeks ago, now it happens all the time. even if i literally tell it that i adapted their code and that it shoudl reanalize it, it still disregards what i'm passing to it and pulls code from before.

so essentially it's refusing to read new code thinking that it is the same, this is basic LLM lazyness and it happens when you reduce the amount of tokens.

That said, I usually find that the second you start working on a problem that doesn’t have a commonly known solution, even if you describe your solution in detail to the point that any intern could pick up the task, there’s a pretty decent chance you’ll get a bad response.

- Use composer for new files that need boilerplate while providing copious examples of similar files

Building an optimized web app isn’t that hard with cursor. You just gotta look at the complexity of that app. There is stuff that will be hard for someone clueless in cursor when it gets too complicated but some basic stuff using APIs and existing libraries? No problem.

But at the end I also have the feeling, the knowledge that you say someone “needs” can kinda be replaced with more grind in many instances. Also those arguments always read like they expect the non developer to be entirely stupid… you can still find out correct approaches to achieve your goals without knowing them at the beginning of the project.. just be honest with yourself and research the things you don’t know… with AI that’s as easy as never before…

The knowledgeable web dev will be way quicker achieving his stuff in cursor because he won’t do all kinds of stupid prompts.

But I would disagree in the notion that it’s impossible to also achieve it without actually being a dev… Just gotta box you out of the endless loops of errors when you don’t understand the issues (or just try again with a different prompt (or just ask for potential solutions and then go over to fix stuff)

Will my code be the best? No. Will I achieve it as quickly as someone with knowledge? No.

Am I be capable of reaching my goals? I would argue yes…

To switch the tables here, I could equally argue that UI and UX cursor applies to the projects isn’t actually on par with following a real Design process and that Devs creating apps with cursor will still build trashy or ugly standard apps because they don’t know how to actually build nice and understandable user flows and stuff like that. What is the superior code worth with a trashy concept?

But here again, I personally believe the dev can achieve good levels with putting enough effort in himself… will it be as quick  to reach the goal or quality wise on paar with a designer doing it? Probably not, but it’s achievable to do great things still…

And if you start with little knowledge and learn what to ask over time you are actually learning programming. Maybe not the syntax of programming, but like the guy who wrote all the programming books Tim oreilly wrote in his blog recently, we’ve just hit a place where the next higher level programming language has become English. I’ve been at this long enough (ai coding) to confidently say nothing just magically appeared without a lot of thoughtful prompting and the English is basically the same as the logic of normal programming without needing to bother with the syntax of a language. 

As a developer it’s actually pretty freeing to vibe code in languages I don’t even understand myself for the most part. The field of programming is large enough that even if you are an expert in one area of it you can’t be in all areas of it. The fundamentals help you leap to other areas and draw parallels like do this thing I would have done in the language I know but in the language I don’t.

2. I know stuff and I’m still spending all my time prompting. Things get done much faster but the stuff I’m attempting to build alone now would have taken a team of 4 before over a period of months. I don’t doubt that the number of developers needed will decrease to create the same output over time, but as has always been in the case in the past the market just demands more. And maybe some day AI will be able to do the whole thing without developers, but right now I’m just trying to make more alone and that has me working all the time. Not sure how long it’s going to be before you don’t actually need any developers any more, but right now it still takes a lot of time with AI to build a full product and someone needs to do it as a job. And from a practical perspective there are real productivity advantages to someone trained in development using these tools over someone who isn’t and can only 100% vibe code. 

What is left to be seen though is what happens when you pit the 100% vibe coders against the developer luddites who refuse to use these new tools, of which there are many. I did a poll a little while back and it was something like 1/3+ developers refused to use ai tools because they were adamant they suck and they preferred the control of doing it all themselves. I think we might see the vibe coders beating experienced Luddite developers with experience at some point as the AI will just be so much faster than manual typing.

I wouldn’t poo poo the power of experienced developers who have also gone all in on these tools though. You don’t know what you don’t know and knowing stuff allows you to connect knowledge to capability instantly with ai. Can’t tell you the number of times I’m watching the agent code and I’m like “why are you doing this? Wouldn’t it make more sense to do this instead?” It course corrects and I save it from junking up the project with another thing it’s going to get confused about later. Which is sort of the other pole of this conversation, the people criticizing the output quality of LLMs. If you can read the code and understand the logic it’s not hard to notice when it leaves a clean pattern and to tell it to fix it and write a rule stopping it from doing it again.

By the time the industry truly doesn’t need developers to make stuff anymore ai agents are going to replace so many other jobs too. Yeah developers are scared to be replaced but everybody should be.

Ive been at this long enough ai coding to confidently say nothing just magically appeared without a lot of thoughtful prompting and the English is basically the same as the logic of normal programming without needing to bother with the syntax of a language. As a developer its actually pretty freeing to vibe code in languages I dont even understand myself for the most part. The field of programming is large enough that even if you are an expert in one area of it you cant be in all areas of it. The fundamentals help you leap to other areas and draw parallels like do this thing I would have done in the language I know but in the language I dont. 2. I know stuff and Im still spending all my time prompting. Things get done much faster but the stuff Im attempting to build alone now would have taken a team of 4 before over a period of months. I dont doubt that the number of developers needed will decrease to create the same output over time, but as has always been in the case in the past the market just demands more. And maybe some day AI will be able to do the whole thing without developers, but right now Im just trying to make more alone and that has me working all the time. Not sure how long its going to be before you dont actually need any developers any more, but right now it still takes a lot of time with AI to build a full product and someone needs to do it as a job. And from a practical perspective there are real productivity advantages to someone trained in development using these tools over someone who isnt and can only 100 vibe code. What is left to be seen though is what happens when you pit the 100 vibe coders against the developer luddites who refuse to use these new tools, of which there are many. I did a poll a little while back and it was something like 13 developers refused to use ai tools because they were adamant they suck and they preferred the control of doing it all themselves. I think we might see the vibe coders beating experienced Luddite developers with experience at some point as the AI will just be so much faster than manual typing. I wouldnt poo poo the power of experienced developers who have also gone all in on these tools though. You dont know what you dont know and knowing stuff allows you to connect knowledge to capability instantly with ai. Cant tell you the number of times Im watching the agent code and Im like why are you doing this? Wouldnt it make more sense to do this instead? It course corrects and I save it from junking up the project with another thing its going to get confused about later. Which is sort of the other pole of this conversation, the people criticizing the output quality of LLMs. If you can read the code and understand the logic its not hard to notice when it leaves a clean pattern and to tell it to fix it and write a rule stopping it from doing it again. By the time the industry truly doesnt need developers to make stuff anymore ai agents are going to replace so many other jobs too. Yeah developers are scared to be replaced but everybody should be. The elite dont have any plan for how the masses are going to make a living once the ai companies achieve their goal of replacing all labor with AI and machines. Thats the scariest part to me.

The scope is largely to achieve the baseline quality that even a very mediocre engineer will bring to the table.

When I look at all kinds of low/no code platforms to build websites and stuff like that for non devs, they are essentially already replaceable.

With AI non devs can suddenly create software. And while the framing here sounds like they would be inferior to the devs I disagree hard.

AI enables all kinds of people from different professional backgrounds to create software and make the ability to code secondary. Those people  surely are worse at coding, but they are way better than most devs at their very own topic.

Medical influenced people could build software concepts from scratch in their field that no dev would ever think of without the needed insight and that no company would ever build due to limited income potential.

It puts the app/software concept at the forefront imo.

mfu83i7,,"Yeah I think where we are disagreeing is you don’t think what you are doing is development because you aren’t writing a programming language to make your software. 

Given I don’t know what you are building I can assume though that you are giving instructions in English that when translated into code by AI are actually closer to code than you might realize. English has become the new higher level programming language. This is conceptually similar to when higher level languages like JavaScript or Python were created to simplify programming and got compiled down into assembly or c++. 

I’m sure there were people at the time who thought coding like that wasn’t real coding because real coding was writing straight assembly. But almost all coding became using higher level languages because it saved so much time.

Development at its core is the progress of starting with some requirements and working with the computer until it can do those requirements.

1j1kemq,"Cursor is a Game-Changer, But You Still Need the Basics","I’ve been in software engineering for over 20 years and hold a PhD in ML. I love Cursor—it’s an incredible tool that can 10x productivity, especially when working within a known language or framework.

For my daily work, I primarily use Python, and most of the time, I know 90% of what needs to be done (the rest I look up along the way). In these cases, Cursor is amazing. It speeds up development, helps with boilerplate code, and fills in gaps efficiently.

However, I’ve also tested Cursor on technologies I wasn’t familiar with. I built a web app in Next.js despite having only worked with Angular before. While I eventually completed the project, it took a lot of iterations and requests. Then, I tried building an iOS app with SwiftUI. This time, I burned through countless requests, got stuck, and ultimately couldn’t finish it. At some point, it felt like I might succeed, but I realized I was just patching things together without fully understanding how they worked.

This experience taught me a key lesson: AI can help tremendously, but it’s not a shortcut to deep understanding. Trying to build a production-ready app without grasping the framework’s core concepts leads to frustration and wasted time.

mci4gu0,,"I have one for you, my man.

I’m non-technical, and this is how I use Cursor:

* **ChatGPT** – I use it for all documentation, prompting, and general product advice. With a clear project description, I actually prefer GPT-4o over all other advanced modules because it’s straightforward and gives me exactly what I need.
* **Notion** – I use it for *all* documentation. I keep everything related to the project—concept overview, customer pain points, tech stack, etc.—on a single page. You *can* organize it under toggle headers for better visuals, but it doesn’t really matter. The *main* reason I use Notion is that ChatGPT can access it. That’s why I keep everything on one big page rather than spreading it across multiple pages—it ensures ChatGPT always has a complete, holistic view of the app.
* **Cursor** – I use it for actual development. Since I usually define the development scope with ChatGPT first, mistakes are minimal. Also, I *almost never* use more than one message in a single Composer session. I have ChatGPT define the prompt so well (including code examples, environment variables, etc.) that it becomes a piece of cake for Composer to execute. I’d say I spend around 60% of my time in ChatGPT defining what needs to be built and learning new things (auth, APIs, whatever), 25% updating Notion (since it has to stay up to date), and only 15% in Cursor actually coding.

I know my approach is kind of like wearing two condoms—super safe. But I’ve tried *raw* prompting in Replit, v0, and even Composer, and all I got were constant headaches and bugs I couldn’t fix as a non-developer.

So, the *MCP* I’d love to have? A constant connection to a knowledge base like Notion. If I could set a project rule that forces Composer to *always* check the documentation before starting *any* development and cross-reference it with the codebase and our goals, I think it would reduce mistakes by 90%.",2025-02-12 21:10:07,1,0,0.0,cursor,anaem1c,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1inw2lt/cursor_interacting_with_chrome_dev_tools/mci4gu0/,"I have one for you, my man.

[https://x.com/kregenrek/status/1892884736059613652](https://x.com/kregenrek/status/1892884736059613652)

**UI Update:**

Cursor 0.46 is here and we got some fresh UI Updates.  
  
Chat -> Ask  
Composer (normal) -> Edit  
Composer (agent) -> Agent  
  
You can switch between modes with ⌘+.

**Git Reference:**

Cursor 0.46 explains you what happened in a specific Git Commit.

https://reddit.com/link/1iuvain/video/lbfq3ajasike1/player

**No window switch anymore**

You can now switch between modes within the same context.  
  
For example, you can ask something and then start the agent based on that or vice versa. This eliminates the need to transfer context between windows.

TBH this is still confusing. I liked the old version better where don't had two buttons with the same highlighting style. It's like having a ""Ok"" and ""Confirm"" button. It also seems to be a bit buggy. If you apply and reapply files a few times, you don't get any changes.

The AIs are good at writing .md files, so give that a go. And figure out ask mode instead of code mode. It saves copypasting at least.","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': 0.9778}",0.9778,"{'polarity': 0.04732289107289105, 'subjectivity': 0.5735462735462736}",0.04732289107289105,0.5735462735462736,Positive,0.9778

It's not surprising to see coders failing to max Cursor, tbh. In a world where the current forward looking premise is that we'll all turn into managers (of agents) it might be a good idea to start to think more in those terms. That's when you'll unlock Cursor.

Perhaps because you're so familiar with technical details, you don't feel the need for AI assistance. Everyone is at different levels and stages, so their requirements for AI will vary accordingly.

For me, AI programming, especially Cursor, is incredibly useful! It brings back that initial feeling of learning to program - that sensation of solving problems with simple thinking. Programming should serve to complete tasks, and if there's a simple way to achieve it, it shouldn't be complicated. When I first learned VB or C, I felt programming was truly enjoyable. Simple tasks could be completed easily, and even complex tasks felt manageable by combining a series of simple methods.

But what has programming become in recent years? New frameworks appear almost every month, each with its own set of complex rules. Now, even implementing the simplest task has become very complicated. For example, adding a browser control to a window - in VB, you could just drag and drop the control, and a few lines of code would complete many tasks. After switching to the .NET platform, this same task became extremely complex. I've done this type of design several times, but I still can't remember how to do it and need to refer to my notes.

Now AI handles all these complex details for you, eliminating the complexity of these frameworks. It allows people to have an easier time. However, AI applications might gradually become more complex themselves - this seems to be a general rule of how things work, and might be unavoidable.

1inn0oy,Use cursor for what its meant for,"Cursor was never designed not intended for people with zero coding knowledge to write apps

I've seen some discussions where people ask if **CursorAI** is a good tool for beginners or even non-programmers, and I think it's important to clarify what it actually does and who it’s for.

At its core, **CursorAI is an AI-powered IDE** built to **enhance a programmer's workflow**, not replace programming knowledge. It’s designed for people who already understand **how to code** and want to speed up development, reduce boilerplate, and get AI-powered assistance in their coding environment. Here's why non-programmers will likely struggle with it:

# 1. You Still Need to Understand Code

CursorAI is **not a no-code or low-code tool**. It doesn't magically build applications for you. It assists **by suggesting code completions, refactoring existing code, debugging, and answering technical questions**—but if you don’t already know how to write and read code, these suggestions won’t make sense.

For example, if you ask Cursor to ""generate a React component,"" it will spit out React code, but **you still need to understand what that code does, how to modify it, and how to integrate it into a larger project**. If you have zero programming knowledge, you'll be stuck wondering what to do with the output.

# 2. AI Assistance ≠ Learning to Code

While CursorAI can help clarify concepts and answer programming questions, it **doesn't replace learning how to program**. A beginner would still be better off learning programming fundamentals through structured resources like freeCodeCamp, CS50, or other beginner courses.

A tool like ChatGPT or DeepSeek might help explain concepts, but **without a foundation in programming, you won’t be able to verify if AI-generated code is correct, efficient, or secure.** AI can hallucinate, make mistakes, and produce inefficient solutions—things that require real programming experience to catch.

# 3. Debugging Requires Knowledge, Not Just AI Assistance

One of CursorAI’s best features is **inline debugging** and error-fixing suggestions. But if you don’t understand programming, **you won’t know why a bug exists, why the AI’s suggestion works (or doesn’t), or what deeper issues might be lurking.**

AI-generated fixes are great, but **blindly applying them without understanding** is a recipe for disaster, especially for complex systems. If a beginner pastes AI-generated code into a project without understanding it, they could introduce bugs that they can’t debug themselves.

# 4. It’s an AI-Powered Productivity Booster for Devs

The main **value proposition of CursorAI** is improving developer productivity. It helps devs **write code faster, debug more efficiently, and generate code snippets for common tasks.**

But it’s not a magic “make an app” button—it won’t teach you:

* How to structure a project
* How different programming languages work
* How to think like a programmer
* How to make architectural decisions

# 5. Non-Programmers Will Be Lost Without Context

A complete beginner using CursorAI would **have no frame of reference** for its suggestions. Even if it generates a full function, **what then?** What file should it go in? How do you test it? What dependencies does it require? Without prior programming experience, these are huge blockers.",2025-02-12 01:14:21,89,71,0.87,cursor,chunkypenguion1991,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1inn0oy/use_cursor_for_what_its_meant_for/,"Use cursor for what its meant for Cursor was never designed not intended for people with zero coding knowledge to write apps

One of CursorAI’s best features is **inline debugging** and error-fixing suggestions. But if you don’t understand programming, **you won’t know why a bug exists, why the AI’s suggestion works (or doesn’t), or what deeper issues might be lurking.**

AI-generated fixes are great, but **blindly applying them without understanding** is a recipe for disaster, especially for complex systems. If a beginner pastes AI-generated code into a project without understanding it, they could introduce bugs that they can’t debug themselves.

# 4. It’s an AI-Powered Productivity Booster for Devs

The main **value proposition of CursorAI** is improving developer productivity. It helps devs **write code faster, debug more efficiently, and generate code snippets for common tasks.**

But it’s not a magic “make an app” button—it won’t teach you:

* How to structure a project
* How different programming languages work
* How to think like a programmer
* How to make architectural decisions

# 5. Non-Programmers Will Be Lost Without Context

A complete beginner using CursorAI would **have no frame of reference** for its suggestions. Even if it generates a full function, **what then?** What file should it go in? How do you test it? What dependencies does it require? Without prior programming experience, these are huge blockers.","Use cursor for what its meant for Cursor was never designed not intended for people with zero coding knowledge to write apps Ive seen some discussions where people ask if CursorAI is a good tool for beginners or even nonprogrammers, and I think its important to clarify what it actually does and who its for. At its core, CursorAI is an AIpowered IDE built to enhance a programmers workflow, not replace programming knowledge. Its designed for people who already understand how to code and want to speed up development, reduce boilerplate, and get AIpowered assistance in their coding environment. Heres why nonprogrammers will likely struggle with it 1. You Still Need to Understand Code CursorAI is not a nocode or lowcode tool. It doesnt magically build applications for you. It assists by suggesting code completions, refactoring existing code, debugging, and answering technical questionsbut if you dont already know how to write and read code, these suggestions wont make sense. For example, if you ask Cursor to generate a React component, it will spit out React code, but you still need to understand what that code does, how to modify it, and how to integrate it into a larger project. If you have zero programming knowledge, youll be stuck wondering what to do with the output. 2. AI Assistance Learning to Code While CursorAI can help clarify concepts and answer programming questions, it doesnt replace learning how to program. A beginner would still be better off learning programming fundamentals through structured resources like freeCodeCamp, CS50, or other beginner courses. A tool like ChatGPT or DeepSeek might help explain concepts, but without a foundation in programming, you wont be able to verify if AIgenerated code is correct, efficient, or secure. AI can hallucinate, make mistakes, and produce inefficient solutionsthings that require real programming experience to catch. 3. Debugging Requires Knowledge, Not Just AI Assistance One of CursorAIs best features is inline debugging and errorfixing suggestions. But if you dont understand programming, you wont know why a bug exists, why the AIs suggestion works or doesnt, or what deeper issues might be lurking. AIgenerated fixes are great, but blindly applying them without understanding is a recipe for disaster, especially for complex systems. If a beginner pastes AIgenerated code into a project without understanding it, they could introduce bugs that they cant debug themselves. 4.

Well, with the new Agent mode, it will put it in the right file, it will generate tests for it, it will even run the tests if you tell it to. And it can use the CLI to install any needed dependencies.

I think if you can have some kind of grasp on what’s going on you can do anything you want, with some trial and error obviously. If some kid in high school wanted to learn how to make apps I think they could totally start with cursor while simultaneously learning programming fundamentals. I think younger people have an easier time picking up stuff like this quickly. Or if you’re just technically inclined you’ll be able to figure things out too. My job does require me to “debug” problems and figure out solutions to complex issues so I guess I have some experience when it comes to problem solving. 

I think people who say that if you have no experience you’re basically a monkey trying to compose Moonlight Sonata are in denial of the power that cursor has, or aren’t using it correctly.

1ikq9m6,Cursor IDE: Setup and Workflow in Larger Projects,"I want to share my development setup and workflow. I have more than 10+ years of development experience and recently switched to coding only in Cursor IDE. I spend about 6 hours every weekday coding in it, plus some extra time on weekends. Let me show you how I've set this up.

## Writing Code Through Tests First

Initially, I wrote code directly in Cursor. While this worked for small repos, it became risky in larger projects - AI-generated code could easily break existing functionality. Being overly careful defeated Cursor's primary benefit: rapid implementation with review during PR.

My colleague Dmitry suggested test-driven development. While I tried full TDD, writing many tests before implementation, while reliable, was too time-consuming. Especially when refactoring interfaces, as I had to rewrite all test cases.

I found a sweet spot with 1-2 integration tests using real credentials. Write one failing test, implement the feature, and get a checkpoint. Add more tests only after the interface stabilizes. When working on feature #16, a quick test run confirms I haven't broken features #1-15.

This creates an efficient AI feedback loop. The test lets AI write code, check results, and fix issues automatically. It's faster than manual verification while keeping the code reliable, even when Cursor rewrites multiple files.

## Breaking Tasks Into Small Steps

Finding the right task size is the most crucial skill I've developed while working with Cursor. The test-first approach works especially well when you write a test for each small, well-defined piece of work. But what's ""small enough""?

It is too big, and the Cursor might go off track, requiring you to roll back everything. Too small, and you'll spend more time writing tests than solving the actual problem. This sweet spot between too big and too small is the most complex skill to explain, but it's what I've been learning the most.

That's why the same task might seem impossible for one developer using Cursor but completely doable for another - even when coding purely by voice. An experienced Cursor user knows how to break down features into the right-sized steps and cover them with tests in a way that builds up the complete feature with minimal human intervention.

## Preserving Thought Process as Documentation

I used to rely heavily on chat history with the AI. Starting a new chat felt risky - I might lose important context or solutions, especially when breaking down an oversized task into smaller pieces. Explaining everything again in a new chat was time-consuming.

Now, I save all our discussions and decisions in design documents and commit to the code. Before PR, I often refine these documents into cleaner documentation, removing some of the intermediate thinking. But by committing even the intermediate files, my colleagues can see my thought process, decision points, and reasoning if they're interested. I can also track the history of these changes.

Documenting our dialogue, overall goals, task breakdowns, and their statuses has made working with Cursor much smoother. I can freely start a new chat, add my design doc for context, and continue from any point. Chat session length no longer worries me.

## Working Exclusively Through Composer Agent

I started with just the chat interface - it supported more models and seemed to give better control over code changes. I was convinced that Composer Agent was just a simplified tool for junior developers learning Cursor IDE. As an experienced developer, I dismissed it as too basic for my needs.

My colleague Daniel kept suggesting I try switching completely to Composer Agent. At first, I maintained my stance - I was too ""advanced"" for such tools. But the ability to roll back to any point in our dialogue, modify the prompt, automatically restore files to that state, and try again turned out to be incredibly powerful. The integrated terminal commands and automatic result viewing made everything faster.

I started using Agent mode occasionally, then more frequently. For the past month, I haven't opened chat or normal Composer mode once - I work exclusively in Composer Agent. I highly recommend trying it, even if you're a seasoned developer. It takes some getting used to, but you maintain full code control, and the benefits are worth it.

## Voice Dictation to Chat Text

I know this part won't resonate with everyone. Many of my developer friends are excellent typists who hate voice interfaces or work in offices where speaking isn't practical. But I've always enjoyed voice interfaces despite being a developer. For me, it just feels natural.

I often work from home, and now I do all my programming in Cursor IDE with 99% of my input through voice using SuperWhisper. For me, it's a perfect setup that works incredibly well. But I understand this approach isn't universal - some developers are much more comfortable expressing themselves through text, and that's perfectly fine.

mboq6km,,"> 1. can you expand on where in your flow you implement the tests? how does this work when working through a feature with cursor?

The test implementation has been woven into my feature development since day one. I start by planning the feature and breaking it into manageable steps, documenting everything in a design doc that serves as our roadmap. This document captures both the overall vision and the detailed steps we'll take to get there.

The cursor and I then collaborated on the testing approach. For each step in the design document, we created a focused integration test that served as a checkpoint for that particular piece of functionality. Most features naturally break into 5-6 steps, giving us a clear set of tests to work with.

The implementation flow is where the magic happens. For each step, I write a test to verify that specific piece, run it to see it fail (classic TDD red stage), and create basic stubs without the actual logic. Then Cursor takes the spotlight - I ask it to implement the code to make our test pass and watch as it works through the solution. The process is quite elegant.

By the end, we have a solid suite of 5-6 tests covering the entire feature, each corresponding to one of our planned steps. It's methodical but feels natural once you get into its rhythm.

> 2. have you implemented any of these best practices through cursor rules that help facilitate them?

Yes, I've implemented these practices across different levels of Cursor configuration - in the IDE-wide settings, in project-level `.cursorrules` files, and sometimes even in `.cursor/rules/*` patterns.

The test implementation has been woven into my feature development since day one. I start by planning the feature and breaking it into manageable steps, documenting everything in a design doc that serves as our roadmap. This document captures both the overall vision and the detailed steps we'll take to get there.

The cursor and I then collaborated on the testing approach. For each step in the design document, we created a focused integration test that served as a checkpoint for that particular piece of functionality. Most features naturally break into 5-6 steps, giving us a clear set of tests to work with.

The implementation flow is where the magic happens. For each step, I write a test to verify that specific piece, run it to see it fail (classic TDD red stage), and create basic stubs without the actual logic. Then Cursor takes the spotlight - I ask it to implement the code to make our test pass and watch as it works through the solution. The process is quite elegant.

By the end, we have a solid suite of 5-6 tests covering the entire feature, each corresponding to one of our planned steps. It's methodical but feels natural once you get into its rhythm.

> 2. have you implemented any of these best practices through cursor rules that help facilitate them?

Yes, I've implemented these practices across different levels of Cursor configuration - in the IDE-wide settings, in project-level `.cursorrules` files, and sometimes even in `.cursor/rules/*` patterns.

One implementation at a time, dont let the agent do any complicated tasks you dont understand yourself yet.","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.903, 'pos': 0.023, 'compound': -0.5984}",-0.5984,"{'polarity': -0.375, 'subjectivity': 0.6125}",-0.375,0.6125,Negative,-0.5984

How many times have you thought

1. This is a lot to keep track of, I'm lost, 'I'm not sure where I am' 
   1. This can be because you had to go off on a tangent to fix a little bug, or, because the task you're trying to do is so big, you've just lost track.
2. I wish I'd documented what I asked for, so I can learn next time how to do this better
3. It's lost, it's forgotten all the little details I told it and now  it's guessing

We have a solution, and it's simple.

In Agent Mode, type out what you want it to do, or better still, type it in a text editor and copy and paste in, you can use new lines simpler.



**\*tell it to PLAN this work and not actually implement it.\***

**\*tell it to ask you questions\***

When it's done that.

write this prompt.

>"" create a [todolist.md](http://todolist.md) file, use check boxes and list all the tasks you need to complete. make each task a tick box, put bullet points below it. then, once completed, you can work down the task list one by one ticking them off.""



You will be wildly impressed to see the [todolist.md](http://todolist.md) file created with tick boxes.

\*2nd to last step....\*

Check in the [Todo.md](http://Todo.md) file to git.   
Now it's checked it, you'll clearly see exactly where it's got too, and any changes made to it, as it goes.

Last step...

How many times have you thought

1. This is a lot to keep track of, I'm lost, 'I'm not sure where I am' 
   1. This can be because you had to go off on a tangent to fix a little bug, or, because the task you're trying to do is so big, you've just lost track.
2. I wish I'd documented what I asked for, so I can learn next time how to do this better
3. It's lost, it's forgotten all the little details I told it and now  it's guessing

We have a solution, and it's simple.

In Agent Mode, type out what you want it to do, or better still, type it in a text editor and copy and paste in, you can use new lines simpler.



**\*tell it to PLAN this work and not actually implement it.\***

**\*tell it to ask you questions\***

When it's done that.

write this prompt.

>"" create a [todolist.md](http://todolist.md) file, use check boxes and list all the tasks you need to complete. make each task a tick box, put bullet points below it. then, once completed, you can work down the task list one by one ticking them off.""



You will be wildly impressed to see the [todolist.md](http://todolist.md) file created with tick boxes.

\*2nd to last step....\*

Check in the [Todo.md](http://Todo.md) file to git.   
Now it's checked it, you'll clearly see exactly where it's got too, and any changes made to it, as it goes.

Last step...

>""implement that tasks in [TODO.md](http://TODO.md), be sure to tick them off as you complete them.""

And off it goes.

1j56j7i,Found a workaround for Cursor context limit,"I found a really good workaround for this problem everyone has been having, but it takes about an hour of setup.

1. Set up a Google Gemini API key (free)
2. Set up `cursor-tools` (you can find this on GitHub)
3. Follow the installation steps and integrate it into your project (the cursorrules file is important)
4. Every time you give big instructions, at the bottom of the prompt tell Agent to ""ask Gemini to help you plan, and when you are finished, ask it to review your work""
5. `cursor-tools` zips the *entire* repo, uploads it to Gemini (which has a 2 million context token window), and it comes back with very clever analysis and a smart feedback loop for Agent. They kind of start talking to each other which is really cool to watch.

This workflow is generating really good results. I guess a lot of the intelligence problems really are down to the context summarisation.

The other thing I found works well is to ignore the new ""Start a new chat for better results"" message. Starting a new chat seems to lower the IQ of Cursor a lot, so I am sticking to the same chat for a day or two until a feature/project is completed.

Edit: I would recommend only attempting this if you are an experienced developer, because I've had to solve numerous configuration issues over the last 24 hours to get to 100% perfection, and even now it could break at any moment. But it is pretty incredible. My Cursor (v0.46.10) is one shotting very complex tasks again with Claude 3.7 Thinking + Gemini Pro.

Notes:

- 0.5.0, the version you can just npm install right now, only seems to work up to 1 million tokens
- 0.6.0-alpha.7 supports OpenRouter and [you can force it to use the 2 million token model](https://github.com/eastlondoner/cursor-tools/issues/57)
- But the alpha version randomly crashes about 1 in 10 times. You will waste fast requests restoring checkpoint and restarting it, if you care about that.
- Auto setup seems to automatically create the .cursorrules file but it doesn't work all the time, you should create the [.mdc](https://github.com/eastlondoner/cursor-tools/blob/2fbb1dfd5760c4712b98489bd133095225432827/.cursor/rules/cursor-tools.mdc) file instead.
- If you have a complex shell setup with zsh, zshell, nvm etc, cursor-tools might not be available inside the Agent's shell. You will have to debug this yourself.

1iojub2,How I solved Cursor's hallucination problems with Supabase using 2 MCP Protocols,"Hey r/cursor!

I wanted to share some interesting findings from my recent experiments with Cursor AI and Supabase integration. Like many of you, I've been frustrated with Cursor occasionally hallucinating when generating React components, especially when dealing with complex database schemas.

I've been working on a solution using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that has dramatically improved the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated code. The key breakthrough came from creating a dedicated MCP server that acts as a ""truth source"" for Supabase schema information.

What's different about this approach:

* Instead of relying on Cursor to interpret database structures from code snippets, the MCP server provides real-time, accurate schema information
* The server understands complex relationships, RLS policies, and type constraints, preventing common AI hallucinations
* Generated React components are always in sync with the actual database structure
* No more back-and-forth fixing incorrect type assumptions or mismatched field names

Some unexpected benefits I discovered:

* The AI generates much more precise TypeScript types since it has direct access to the schema
* RLS policies are automatically considered when generating data fetching logic
* Foreign key relationships are properly maintained in forms and data displays
* Schema changes are immediately reflected without needing to update context files

I've also developed a dynamic context system using gemini-2.0-pro-exp that automatically updates as your codebase context and instructions as it evolves, which has been a game-changer for larger projects. The AI seems to understand the codebase much better than with static  @ Codebase references.

Questions for the community:

* Has anyone else experimented with MCP for improving AI accuracy?
* What are your biggest pain points with Cursor generating database-connected components?
* Would you be interested in seeing this released as an open-source tool?

I'm particularly curious about your experiences with Cursor hallucinations in database-heavy applications and how you've addressed them.

It supports Rust, and I should be wrapping up TypeScript support in the next few days.","Well done!

Cursor can send questions like what are the ids of the button elements on he page or even stuff like why is the X button not visible to this and get back answers which help it to write tests just like how you might use the inspector to inspect the page when writing playwright. cursortools uses stagehand to have another AI drive playwright so its more like teamwork between AI agents. Cursor can send high level instructions like log in and the other AI deals with figuring out what to do with the browser and it reports back how it gets on. And, as shown in the video, this has an interactive stateful mode where the browser can stay open and you can work collaboratively with the AI on the same browser state step by step","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.166, 'compound': 0.9863}",0.9863,"{'polarity': 0.14863636363636365, 'subjectivity': 0.36272727272727273}",0.14863636363636365,0.36272727272727273,Positive,0.9863

While I discard most of them for lacking unique value, some truly stand out. However, with the influx of options, it can be challenging to find the best ones.

1. ChatGPT Mac app - primarily because of a team pro subscription.  

2. Repo Prompt - also due to the team pro subscription. However, it will soon shift to a paid plan, and I plan to switch to a free alternative or create my own version by forking PasteMax. I expect some MCP features will be introduced in the ChatGPT Mac app, or we may transition to Claude.  

3. [itsdart.com](http://itsdart.com) \- I have been using it daily since I installed it.  

4. Ollama - for testing models and more.  

5. Several tools from Simon Willison (https://simonwillison.net/) and his blog, which I read daily. I prefer this over getting lost in a flood of YouTube ""content"" creators, as it helps maintain my productivity.  

6. Talktastic as my VTT.  

7. Goose - I'm unsure about it; it's still buggy, and if we switch to Claude, I would likely stick with that.  

8. Aider - I still use it, but less frequently, as Cursor, Roo, Cline, etc., have been equally effective. I find I waste more time switching between tools and catching up on change logs than learning how to maximize one or two tools.

1j2rgj2,🚀 Just Released: Cursor Rules CLI - Auto-scan your project & install relevant Cursor rules in one command,"Disclaimer: This is a community-driven project not officially associated with Cursor.I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions! Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey r/cursor community!

I'm excited to share a tool I've been working on that makes finding and installing Cursor rules super easy: Cursor Rules CLI.

https://i.redd.it/sk0xovit2jme1.gif

What it does:

* 🔍 Automatically scans your project to detect libraries and frameworks
* 📥 Installs the most relevant Cursor rules directly to your rules folder
* 🎨 Beautiful, intuitive CLI interface
* 🔒 100% privacy-focused (all scanning happens locally)

How it works: Just run cursor-rules in your project directory, and it does all the work for you - no more manual searching or guessing which rules you need!

    pip install cursor-rules
    # Scan your project and install matching rules
    cursor-rules

What makes it special: The rules are created using a  two-step process:

1. Semantic search with Exa to gather best practices
2. LLM enhancement to create structured, optimized content

I have it build a heavy amount of unit testing. I make it get up to 80% code coverage (80% of the lines of code are tested). I also ask it to build end-to-end tests.

I also have a container spun up that pings this endpoint and ensures all of the pieces work.

1ipqiyg,Maximizing Cursor AI – What’s Your Best Workflow Hack?,"I’ve been using the Cursor pro plan for close to **4 months now**. I’m constantly trying out new ways to optimize my workflow to write code easier/faster.

**These have worked for me:**

* Optimizing `.cursorrules` by having the agent ""self-improve"" the rules after a coding session.
* Using debug statements liberally to help the agent find issues
* I ask it to start every reply with a random animal emoji 🦊. If I no longer see the emoji then I know it’s lost context

**Wins:**

* The self-improvement does seem to help to a point
* I am pretty hard core about starting new sessions an that helps a lot
* Debug statements do help it fix issues. Without them it tends to spin out.

**Losses:**

* Agent mode spins out when working on less popular tech (not js or react).
   * Firebase functions written in typescript
   * SwiftUI code
   * Svelte 5
* Forgetting to use a `.cursorrules` file or the new rules/\* in a project

In ChatGPT Plus (webGUI), I have had a long chat, brainstorm session, detailing as much as possible: project summary, goals, milestones, features, etc. After I had all I _thought I needed_, I told ChatGPT to ask me 10 questions about the project to help it further understand. 

This took me about two days, answering in depth all I could about these projects. One is a ecommerce with NuxtUI, SquareAPI & Supabase. Other is for an automotive enthusiast community using Shadcn & Supabase. Both with Supabase buckets for storage, auth, members, uploads, etc.

I had ChatGPT + Canvas create a `readme-brainstorm.md` from all the information we generated. From there several others were created `readme-milestone-planning.md` and `readme-next-days-agenda.md`.

In Cursor, after init new project, install all dependencies, I told it to read the above readme docs and break it down into more manageable files. 

`readme-milestone-planning.md` has all the project goals, tasks, sub-tasks, version numbers for releases/deployments. We update this frequently throughout the day. Some of the larger tasks got their own docs file.

`readme-next-days-agenda.md` has 3 main headings: Current Project Status, Completed Today, and Next Steps. We refer to this at the start and end of my 'Daily Sprints'.

The second project has grown far more complex than initially anticipated. And we often times end up creating new `readme-*.md` docs. At this point I now have over a dozen markdown docs files: schema, seo, terms, testing-strategy, various features.

Also, I started with a basic `.cursorrules` file and tell Cursor to update as needed.

Example: sometimes it wants to install something we don't need or is already installed, or sometimes vee-validate would conflict with shadcn, or it would forget to use `<NuxtImg>` instead of `<img>`.

Recently we struggled to get proper form sumission handler typing correct. After we got the right syntax, I asked Composer ""what did we learn today?"", and it would outline what it did wrong and what the solution was. So I would tell it to add that solution to `.cursorrules`.

My cursorrules file is over 400 lines long. I got curious around 300 lines, thinking it was too big/complex. I've seen others use markdown for their rules, but mine is json formatted. I duplicated the cursorrules (.cursorrules-01 & .cursorrules-020, one in markdown, the other json structured. In Composer I told it to read both files and asked it which it preferred?! It actually chose the json structure. It said it preferred that method, so I told it to rewrite it to be more efficient, and it ended up restructuring the whole thing along with varying priorities, references to my other doc files, it listed all the Nuxt modules in use.

1j21lo8,Cursor vs Claude Code,"I've tried Claude Code over the last few days on a few Ruby on Rails 7 and 8 codebases that I work on.   
  
It's interesting, and it has a few features that would be good additions to Cursor.   
  
Compared to cursor:

The good:

* Very high code quality. This thing blows Cursor out of the water. I can't believe both use the same model when I see the difference in how Claude-3.7 behaves in Cursor and how it behaves in Claude Code. It's a completely different experience, on the same codebase with the same model. 
* It reports if its context is nearly filled, and allows you to compact it (summarise) or clear it. Great feature that Cursor should have too. 
* No 'can't connect to Anthropic' or 'can't connect to OpenAI' errors.
* Less errors compared to Cursor operating on the same codebase after writing code.
* I've had no functionality breaking mistakes, which do happen every now and then with Cursor, where it just breaks something or large files are truncated. 

The bad:

* It's not an IDE, but a node based terminal application that works on your codebase. That makes it a bit harder to work with (it would be fun to run it on an old VT200 terminal by the way). 
* The price! Working on just a few new features in a Rails app for around 3 hours kost me around $20,- in Claude Code. That's not cheap compared to what I pay for Cursor in a month and definitely something Claude should fix. 
* No MCP servers in Claude Code (at least I haven't been able to figure out how), though I haven't really missed them. Since it's a terminal app, Claude Code can execute all sorts of commands.   
* Cursor on the other hand is much cheaper, but that might also be its downfall. I'm perfectly willing to to pay more for Cursor if the quality it delivers is higher and more consistent.

1iqmbv7,Let Cursor & Windsurf interact with your Supabase autonomously,"So... this weekend I've had some time on my hands and decided to finally explore how to build and work with MCP servers.

Well... it turns out if you connect Supabase to Cursor / Windsurf via MCP server you essentially get an AI database agent that can not only write SQL queries (baby stuff), but actually:

* execute them
* debug them
* iterate on them

It's now possible to just ask it ""Count the number of messages my users sent"" and it will iterate until completion. 🤯 Check out how it works in the demo video.

\---

**How to set it up:**

* Clone the repo
* Install dependencies
* Add MCP server to Cursor & Windsurf
* Enjoy! 🙌

mcd5wig,,"First of all, Cursor is not ""AI"", it's a program that uses AI to do many things. So you can criticize cursor's integration of AI, and also the AI separately.

Many of the LLMs in Cursor are, indeed, very poorly optimized for many purposes. That's why you have to learn what things they're good at, and which aren't. You already stated you use it, so you should know a few of these things.

For example, if you're having a complex bug in a piece of code, just giving it to sonnet or gpt-4o is most likely not going to give you a solution. LLMs are trained from autocomplete models, so they're likely to follow a pattern.

- Sonnet, for example, is trained to always think it knows what the problem is, so it will confidently propose changes that do nothing, or even worse, break the program more than it already was broken.
- gpt-4o has a good general picture of things, sometimes better than sonnet, especially for strategy, but it's much poorer regarding implementation and troubleshooting.
- deepseek r1 has a very good thinking process, which you can copypaste into sonnet to get much better troubleshooting from the thinking and observation of the more ""thoughtful"" model (r1), and then hand it to the more optimized ""implementation"" model (sonnet)
- o1 is very good at both thinking and implementation, though not necessarily better in all things than sonnet, but it can definitely read code better and find hidden issues more easily.
- o1 pro, when used from the ChatGPT Pro interface, is much better than the normal o1, due to the unlimited allotted thinking time, which is very short compared to r1 for example

So in the end, pick the right tools. Picking the right tools is considered a skill. So skill issue, git gud.

mbtotcl,,"It's interesting to see everyone's take on this. GitHub Copilot has been around before GPT3 even came out. It was the OG code completion tool. Recently, I've only played around with Cursor Chat, so I don't have a personal opinion, but based on what I've seen in testing results, Cursor seems like the most polished coding assistant out there rn.

Here's my two cents: even though all these AI assistants are built on basically the same underlying models, the real magic  happens in how they handle context. The way each tool picks and feeds in context—and then fine-tunes the model to produce the output the IDE expects—is crucial. If any of those steps are off, the model ends up asking for extra prompts to fix itself. The more iterations you need for a single feature, the longer your context gets, which only increases the chances for the AI to get all confused and mess up its output. Cursor is opaque, so I don't really know how it works, but it must have trained some pretty good custom models for RAG, context management, and output alignment.

If you're letting AI write your code, you should want something that consistently spits out correct code. Code correctness is worth way more than a measly $10, especially if you're relying on it for more than just learning.

mbhug4m,,"The ""story"" of each and every developer will be different depending on their level of experience in software development and the stack they're familiar with.

After spending >500 hours in the last 2 months with AI-assisted IDEs (namely Cursor and Windsurf), I can easily say that for a senior developer, these tools improve your productivity to create a full-scale project by at least 50x. If you already have the full-stack knowledge of creating an application (web or mobile), it's amazingly fast to develop.

It's not all sunshine and rainbows, of course. As we all live the very early days of these tools, there were many times I felt too frustrated by the unpredictable performance of these tools. I spent literally hours to just try to ""make tool do the job"" for some relatively simple tasks. For the sake of ""learning"" how to use these tools optimally, I stayed mostly persistent and got the job done every time (like almost).

On the other hand, for a beginner level or mid level developer, I don't see an easy path to create full-scale production ready apps with these tools ""yet"". There's going to be A LOT OF challenges you'll run into and LLMs will try things as if they fell into some infinite cycle of unsuccessful attempts. You must know how to lead them and put them into the right direction. Otherwise, you can't finish an actual product.

- from here i start the composer, and step bij step the composer will ask, shall i implement a, shall i implement b. Check every time in between if it works, if not, fix it. (The annoying part you mentioned as well)

Its important to explicitly tell the ai anytime it wants to make an assumption or if it isn't sure about anything regarding code or requirements, it must ask questions to clarify. This is crucial. It will give you a list of questions after your prompt and you must answer it thoroughly. 

Often ai models will recognize there's a lot of code implementation to do (error management, loading displays, code reuse), dont have it do this while you're trying to solve a bug or make an implementation of a feature. Either do this before or after your implementations. 

Never have the ai model code too much. One feature/task at a time. 

Use new composer chats after each feature.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Don't Repeat Yourself Principle (DRY)
Keep it Simple Stupid Principle (KISS)

Mentioning these 3 principles helps make sure the ai checks its work after it recommends a solution. 

For your first prompt about a feature implementation or bug investigation, ask the ai to outline its investigation or solution implementation plan in detailed English (no code). Assess the response and correct any mistakes it has. It's better to do this in English rather than code.

**Update 1:**

You can ""stack"" your cursor  rules.

In the screenshot you can see that I have a ""global"" rule and a specific rule for extensions.

you can also see that in the reasoning step in the composer.

**Sidenote:** Some User reports that it crashes cursor so use this with caution

**Update 2:**

Cursor Rules supports inheritance. If you have ever worked with CSS, this should be a familiar concept.

For example, create a base .mdc rule and reference it in your other rules. Keeps everything clean and separate.

**Update 3:**

Regarding deprecated .cursorrules. Smth. in me hopes that doesn't happen → everyone needs to migrate. In the long run, the name .cursorrules is an understatement of the agent's powerful capabilities.

Workaround: Create an \[whateveryouwant\].mdc (agent was just an example) file as an replacement for the .cursorrules. Add the ""\*"" for global (missed it in the screenshot)

1j17kgo,Quick Guide: Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP (talk to your database),"**Quick Guide: Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP**

If you're trying to hook up your Supabase database with Cursor (using MCP), here's a quick, straightforward guide. This setup lets you interact directly with your database through natural language—so you can just tell Cursor Composer what you want (like querying data, adding tables, etc.) without fiddling with manual SQL every time.

I struggled for hours last night because I skipped this step at first. Without this, Cursor just couldn't get accurate context from Supabase, even when I fed it the docs directly.

Here's what worked for me:

**Step 1: Get your Supabase connection string**

* Log in at [Supabase]() and pick your project.
* Head over to your project's connection settings.
* You’ll see a connection string there. Replace any placeholder passwords with your actual database password.
* Copy this entire connection string (you'll need it for Cursor).

**Step 2: Add your MCP server in Cursor**

* Open Cursor and navigate to Settings → Features.
* Scroll down past the ""Codebase indexing"" section until you see the MCP servers area.
* Click on **""Add New MCP Server""**.
   * Set type as **Command**.
   * Name it clearly (mine is just ""Supabase - My App"").
   * Paste the connection string you copied from Supabase here.
* Hit save.

**Step 3: Try it out**

* Now you can use Cursor Composer or similar tools to run queries directly against your Supabase database without leaving Cursor.
* Run a quick test (like asking it for a list of tables) to make sure it's connected properly.

Quick tip from experience—make sure you back up your database first. I didn't, and cleaning up mistakes afterwards took ages.

Hope this saves someone else the headache!

   * Name it clearly (mine is just ""Supabase - My App"").
   * Paste the connection string you copied from Supabase here.
* Hit save.

**Step 3: Try it out**

* Now you can use Cursor Composer or similar tools to run queries directly against your Supabase database without leaving Cursor.
* Run a quick test (like asking it for a list of tables) to make sure it's connected properly.

Quick tip from experience—make sure you back up your database first. I didn't, and cleaning up mistakes afterwards took ages.

Hope this saves someone else the headache!

","Quick Guide Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP talk to your database Quick Guide Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP If youre trying to hook up your Supabase database with Cursor using MCP, heres a quick, straightforward guide. This setup lets you interact directly with your database through natural languageso you can just tell Cursor Composer what you want like querying data, adding tables, etc. without fiddling with manual SQL every time. I struggled for hours last night because I skipped this step at first. Without this, Cursor just couldnt get accurate context from Supabase, even when I fed it the docs directly. Heres what worked for me Step 1 Get your Supabase connection string Log in at Supabase and pick your project. Head over to your projects connection settings. Youll see a connection string there. Replace any placeholder passwords with your actual database password. Copy this entire connection string youll need it for Cursor. Step 2 Add your MCP server in Cursor Open Cursor and navigate to Settings Features. Scroll down past the Codebase indexing section until you see the MCP servers area. Click on Add New MCP Server. Set type as Command. Name it clearly mine is just Supabase My App. Paste the connection string you copied from Supabase here. Hit save. Step 3 Try it out Now you can use Cursor Composer or similar tools to run queries directly against your Supabase database without leaving Cursor.

1j6qm58,Cursor DESTROYED MailChimp in 304 words,"Have you ever wanted to send email 'alerts' to your customers?

You probably thought of Mailchimp, or if you're into open source Mautic. Both great options, but I have serious number of different lists to create and aspirations for more.

This is how Cursor wrote a complete, working, fully functional, I mean confirmation double opt in, the alert email template, subscriber list, preference page, subscribe box, the whole lot in ... THREE HUNDRED WORDS of prompting!

Let's back up a bit, a little context

I created [https://pricepergig.com/](https://pricepergig.com/) \- a site to sort, filter, find all the cheapest hard disk drives, SSD and NVMe drives, order by price per GB/TB and now, get instant alerts so you get the cheapest prices.

The problem? Send email alerts to people with the current cheapest HDD, SSD, NVMe drive on their chosen Amazon store for their chosen threshold. e.g. I want amazon co uk hard disks, known brands, where they are less than £13/TB, don't send me anything more expensive than that.

I worked out, with about 8 amazon websites, known brands, unknown brands, HDD, SSD, and NVMe, that a total of 72 different 'lists' on something like Mailchimp (I don't know if it can do variables, Mautic can, but one look at the docs and I'm thinking, but Cursor can just do this).

ANYWAY - I'm a developer with super powers (aka Cursor) so I'll just write my own...

I use my spec document technique, and only 304 words, played on the xbox for 20 mins (I am terrible at Warzone), clicked 'accept' a bunch of times, went to make a cup of tea to review and BOOM, I had 'confirmation' emails AND a fully working 'alert' email. 

It would have taken me longer to make the two email templates alone! This is incredible .

Thanks @ Cursor.  


\# Only if you're interested, here are the prompts #

  
Using my spec document technique, I wrote the spec - and I'm cheating a bit here, I'm not including these words in the word count BECAUSE I'd have to a) write this for a human to implement or b) go read all the docs for mailchimp or mautic and click around for hours figuring it out, so this, imo, is less work than any of those.

    # Goal
    
    We want to send emails to users when they have certain thresholds of listings.
    
    # Features
    
    User's on the front end can subscribe to emails, at that point they choose the options they would like notifications for along with a price per TB or price per GB. threshold to be met.
    When the best price in that category is met, we send an email to the user with the listing details and link directly to the listing.
    
    We will store the users email address and preferences in a table.
    
    We need a front end for the user to manage their email preferences. 
    Users should have to double opt in / confirm their email address for it to become active on the list. 
    
    we should use the same react components for the user preferences as we do on the main site/subscribe component.
    
    we will also need a super simple front end looking component that takes just the user's email address. when a user enters their email address and a threshold price we should send that to the backend and store it in the database, then send the user a confirmation email, once the user confirms their email address we should update the user's status to active on the list. The user can then update their exact preferences.
    
    ## User preferences
    Users can choose from the following options to get notified for:
                ""nvme-m2"" - Cheapest NVMe M.2 SSD (any brand)
                ""nvme-m2-branded"" - Cheapest NVMe M.2 SSD (known branded)
                ""ssd-internal"" - Cheapest Internal SSD (any brand)
                ""ssd-internal-branded"" - Cheapest Internal SSD (known branded)
                ""hdd-internal"" - Cheapest Internal HDD (any brand)
                ""hdd-internal-branded"" - Cheapest Internal HDD (known branded)
    you will find we already calculate the best price for any item in the database in the pricepergig-backend-webapi/webapi/PPG.Services/BestListingService.cs file. we already have a webhook, we just need to add the logic to call an email service or similar there with the new best listing details - then the new notification service will handle the rest (find users that wanted that notification/threshold etc. and send them an email)
    
    Users can choose their language, but during the signup process we should just default to the currently selected language on the site (set in /ppg/pricepergig-frontend/src/Header.tsx and not need to ask the user this. they can change it on the larger preferences page later if they want to)
    
    
    ## User Interface components/things
    1 - simple sign up form - we get the users email address and the threshold price they want to be notified for.
    2 - confirmation email - we send a confirmation email to the user's email address, once they confirm their email address we update the user's status to active on the list. The user can then update their exact preferences.
    3 - preferences page - the user can update their exact preferences from this page, they can also unsubscribe from the list here.
    4 - unsubscribe link - the user can unsubscribe from the list from this page - but it will just take them to the preferences page.
    
    # Technologies
    
    We will use a hosted SMTP service to send the emails such as SendGrid, but we'll need the smtp details to configure this - they can be configured in the pricepergig-backend-webapi/webapi/EnvironmentVariables.cs file.
    
    We will use hangfire to handle the scheduling of the emails, this way we can 'fire and forget' and not have to keep the application running to send the emails as each time hangfire is started it will resume the emails job from where it left off.# Goal

And, this is my prompts, and if you read, you'll see, a good few prompts were because I had a file called EmailService already that didn't actually do anything other than send me one email each day so I knew the server was up and running.



1. update this file with the single storypoint tasks, make them a check list so that you can follow it later. you should read the codebase and make it clear what you can do - make a good PLAN you can execute later

1. Implement each of the # Single Storypoint Task in thsi file, you shoudl implement them and tick them off as you go. think hard, work methodically. complete the ENTIRE WORKLOAD - keep reminding yourself to look back at this task list and complete it.
2. the migration was created coontinue, you MUST update the Email list document tick boxes as you go

1. continue
2. hey, why don't you try building the back end and fixing the errors
3. try cd pricepergig-backend/webapi dotnet build
4. the problem is u/EmailService.cs and u/EmailService.cs I think the one in the utils folder should be renamed to EmailSenderService
5. ok, now run the new unit tests if you can, we've never done that before in here.
6. you don't need to mock them, just create them and use them and pass them in right? why mock something that dons't need mocking?
7. update this and write some simple instructions for me to test, e.g. i can't even 'see' the subscribe box
8. ok, you've used a new framework for api calls, axios . I think these api calls are simple, just use the native fetch apis go read u/App.tsx as to examples of us using this. now update your email code to use that on the front end so we don't need more libraries.
9. yeah do we need api.pricepergig.com? I don't know what that's about we always use 'baseurl'/api/ instead so can you follow the same, because otherwise that another domain to setup. perhaps you don't know how backened api is, it's just backend.pricepergig.com - api would have been better, but never mind, it's backend.pricepergig.com



I really need to get cursor to not go adding random frameworks, maybe a more complete # Technology section? How do you deal with that?

    you will find we already calculate the best price for any item in the database in the pricepergig-backend-webapi/webapi/PPG.Services/BestListingService.cs file. we already have a webhook, we just need to add the logic to call an email service or similar there with the new best listing details - then the new notification service will handle the rest (find users that wanted that notification/threshold etc. and send them an email)
    
    Users can choose their language, but during the signup process we should just default to the currently selected language on the site (set in /ppg/pricepergig-frontend/src/Header.tsx and not need to ask the user this. they can change it on the larger preferences page later if they want to)
    
    
    ## User Interface components/things
    1 - simple sign up form - we get the users email address and the threshold price they want to be notified for.
    2 - confirmation email - we send a confirmation email to the user's email address, once they confirm their email address we update the user's status to active on the list. The user can then update their exact preferences.
    3 - preferences page - the user can update their exact preferences from this page, they can also unsubscribe from the list here.
    4 - unsubscribe link - the user can unsubscribe from the list from this page - but it will just take them to the preferences page.

And, this is my prompts, and if you read, you'll see, a good few prompts were because I had a file called EmailService already that didn't actually do anything other than send me one email each day so I knew the server was up and running.



1. update this file with the single storypoint tasks, make them a check list so that you can follow it later. you should read the codebase and make it clear what you can do - make a good PLAN you can execute later

1. Implement each of the # Single Storypoint Task in thsi file, you shoudl implement them and tick them off as you go. think hard, work methodically. complete the ENTIRE WORKLOAD - keep reminding yourself to look back at this task list and complete it.
2. the migration was created coontinue, you MUST update the Email list document tick boxes as you go

1. continue
2. hey, why don't you try building the back end and fixing the errors
3. try cd pricepergig-backend/webapi dotnet build
4. the problem is u/EmailService.cs and u/EmailService.cs I think the one in the utils folder should be renamed to EmailSenderService
5. ok, now run the new unit tests if you can, we've never done that before in here.
6. you don't need to mock them, just create them and use them and pass them in right? why mock something that dons't need mocking?
7. update this and write some simple instructions for me to test, e.g. i can't even 'see' the subscribe box
8. ok, you've used a new framework for api calls, axios . I think these api calls are simple, just use the native fetch apis go read u/App.tsx as to examples of us using this. now update your email code to use that on the front end so we don't need more libraries.
9. yeah do we need api.pricepergig.com? I don't know what that's about we always use 'baseurl'/api/ instead so can you follow the same, because otherwise that another domain to setup. perhaps you don't know how backened api is, it's just backend.pricepergig.com - api would have been better, but never mind, it's backend.pricepergig.com



I really need to get cursor to not go adding random frameworks, maybe a more complete # Technology section? How do you deal with that?





  
","Cursor DESTROYED MailChimp in 304 words Have you ever wanted to send email alerts to your customers? You probably thought of Mailchimp, or if youre into open source Mautic. Both great options, but I have serious number of different lists to create and aspirations for more. This is how Cursor wrote a complete, working, fully functional, I mean confirmation double opt in, the alert email template, subscriber list, preference page, subscribe box, the whole lot in ... THREE HUNDRED WORDS of prompting! Lets back up a bit, a little context I created a site to sort, filter, find all the cheapest hard disk drives, SSD and NVMe drives, order by price per GBTB and now, get instant alerts so you get the cheapest prices. The problem? Send email alerts to people with the current cheapest HDD, SSD, NVMe drive on their chosen Amazon store for their chosen threshold. e.g. I want amazon co uk hard disks, known brands, where they are less than 13TB, dont send me anything more expensive than that. I worked out, with about 8 amazon websites, known brands, unknown brands, HDD, SSD, and NVMe, that a total of 72 different lists on something like Mailchimp I dont know if it can do variables, Mautic can, but one look at the docs and Im thinking, but Cursor can just do this. ANYWAY Im a developer with super powers aka Cursor so Ill just write my own... I use my spec document technique, and only 304 words, played on the xbox for 20 mins I am terrible at Warzone, clicked accept a bunch of times, went to make a cup of tea to review and BOOM, I had confirmation emails AND a fully working alert email. It would have taken me longer to make the two email templates alone! This is incredible . Thanks Cursor. Only if youre interested, here are the prompts Using my spec document technique, I wrote the spec and Im cheating a bit here, Im not including these words in the word count BECAUSE Id have to a write this for a human to implement or b go read all the docs for mailchimp or mautic and click around for hours figuring it out, so this, imo, is less work than any of those.

1itwarj,"Reflection of Cursor vs Windsurf. Normally I wouldn’t have tried Windsurf, but…","Guys, I have been switching over from cursor and there's a couple of things that are a little bit annoying me in my workflow:

1) Not being able to simply drag and drop the relevant files from the file tree into the Cascade/Chat.

2) Having no clear distinction of the chat and the cascade, whereas in cursor, I had those two nicely separated. So I had a nice separation of concerns there where I could blast off questions in unrelated topics on the chat side and then do feature buildouts via the composer side. That's something that I'm missing as well.

3) Sometimes when cascades builds something out and when I click to see the code it has written, it doesn't even highlight. So it was very hard to see what exactly changed

4) In cursor, the sidebar is actually sitting on top of the file tree explorer. Is there any way to change it back to the top like it is in cursor?  I feel like that part takes off a significant amount of screen real estate in a sense that it can cut off some file namings and I have to decrease my code view.



What I like about Windsurf:

1) Better clarity on the token usage.

2) The UI looks very clean and nice and the branding is growing on me.

3) Deepseek v3 free

4) minor aspects of the experience that makes you feel that they are much more polising the product, whereas it feels as cursor might be experiencing an increasing level of bureacracy.

5) Better pricing and high usage tier.




The reality of the matter is I wouldn't have even changed to Windsurf if it weren't for the deprecation of adding more fast requests to cursor. I actually only later saw that putting in your own API key would actually be almost the same cost as if it were for paying regular 500 requests, but that wasn't clearly communicated in their user experience (but then why depricate it?)

Stay tuned!","Once you exhaust the 500 fast premium requests that come with your monthly Pro subscription, we continue to try to server you fast requests, but when theres peak usage on the platform you can be dropped into the slow pool where youll encounter wait times on responses. The more requests you make while in this pool, the longer your wait time will grow. There are a couple ways to mitigate this. You can enable usagebased for premium models from the account settings page at which will allow you to purchase additional fast requests on a payasyougo model. You set a budget and choose when to turn on or off this option, and youll be guaranteed fast requests when its enabled. You can also use a free model like cursorsmall or deepseekv3 which will allow you to avoid the slow pool.

1ijxt96,"Testing Cursor Pro for a month, here are my impressions","Hey guys, just wanted to share my experience with cursor and AI agents

I'm a react native developer and I was working on a react native upgrade, it was a really complex task so I wasn't expecting anything from cursor, but just as a test I asked for it to ""upgrade the react native version to version 0.72.17, check the libraries in package.json and upgrade them to the version that had compatibility with react antive 0.72.17""

Well, as I expected, it was a shit show, AI hallucinated and started to use random versions of libraries, terrible... 0/10

After that I started doing it manually and tried to use cursor to check the compatibility matrix with the react native I was targeting, I was hopeful that cursor could save me a few inutes for every package that I was upgrading, and the results? Terrible again, AI agents couldnt find the correct compatibility matrix and tried to add the wrong version of the libraries, at this point it was increasing my workload instead of decreasing... 0/10

So I decided to upgrade and search the compatiblity matrix by myself, did all the setup manually and I was ready to start the compile of my binary, I was expecting build errors. Every time a new build error appeared I tried to ask cursor for a fix, the agent seems to be progressing slowly and going on the right direction, but after a few hours running in circles I decided to drop everything they done and search the errors directly using google. I fixed it in 40min... 0/10

Well everything seems to be working now and cursor had a total of at least -5 in contributions, meaning that they improved my workload instead of decreasing, but that's fine, after all I did read that most of the AI agents excelled in automated tests.

Now I do have a LARGE suite of tests that I need to pass through and fix. Since the AI agent seems a bit  dumb I wouldnt dare to ask it to run the tests and fix it, so I found a test suite that was breaking and asked it to run.  
So my test suit had 48 unit tests, and it was breaking in 19 of those tests due to the changes in libraries and versions. To fix it we only needed to update the mocks of the tests, so I asked cursor to run the test file and fix the issue, and oh boy, if cursor was bad before now it was terrible  
The AI agent started changing and breaking my JS file (not the .test.js file), and instead of fixing the test file it tried to change my original file to make the test pass, it was like it tried to work in reverse order, breaking the app to make a broken test pass... Anyway after almost 40min trying different composers and agents I decided to fix it manually, upgraded the mocks and fixed everything in 15min, all tests are passing... 0/10

Anyway, after 1 month testing and trying to use cursor and AI agents, my experience is that it increased my workload and interfered with my productivity, so my final rating for cursor pro and AI agents at this moment is

Well, as I expected, it was a shit show, AI hallucinated and started to use random versions of libraries, terrible... 0/10

After that I started doing it manually and tried to use cursor to check the compatibility matrix with the react native I was targeting, I was hopeful that cursor could save me a few inutes for every package that I was upgrading, and the results? Terrible again, AI agents couldnt find the correct compatibility matrix and tried to add the wrong version of the libraries, at this point it was increasing my workload instead of decreasing... 0/10

So I decided to upgrade and search the compatiblity matrix by myself, did all the setup manually and I was ready to start the compile of my binary, I was expecting build errors. Every time a new build error appeared I tried to ask cursor for a fix, the agent seems to be progressing slowly and going on the right direction, but after a few hours running in circles I decided to drop everything they done and search the errors directly using google. I fixed it in 40min... 0/10

Well everything seems to be working now and cursor had a total of at least -5 in contributions, meaning that they improved my workload instead of decreasing, but that's fine, after all I did read that most of the AI agents excelled in automated tests.

Now I do have a LARGE suite of tests that I need to pass through and fix. Since the AI agent seems a bit  dumb I wouldnt dare to ask it to run the tests and fix it, so I found a test suite that was breaking and asked it to run.  
So my test suit had 48 unit tests, and it was breaking in 19 of those tests due to the changes in libraries and versions. To fix it we only needed to update the mocks of the tests, so I asked cursor to run the test file and fix the issue, and oh boy, if cursor was bad before now it was terrible  
The AI agent started changing and breaking my JS file (not the .test.js file), and instead of fixing the test file it tried to change my original file to make the test pass, it was like it tried to work in reverse order, breaking the app to make a broken test pass... Anyway after almost 40min trying different composers and agents I decided to fix it manually, upgraded the mocks and fixed everything in 15min, all tests are passing... 0/10

Anyway, after 1 month testing and trying to use cursor and AI agents, my experience is that it increased my workload and interfered with my productivity, so my final rating for cursor pro and AI agents at this moment is

mbiqeo7,,"My Tips for Using Cursor AI:

1. Use composer in normal mode.
2. Give it context. Load specific files into Composer so the AI knows what it's working with. It makes a huge difference.
3. Take it one step at a time. Don’t overload it with too many tasks at once. Smaller, focused prompts work best.
4.  Reset when needed. If things start getting messy or off-track, start a fresh Composer session.
5. Pick the right model. Not all models are great for every task. I mostly use Claude Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o for general coding, o1 for trickier problems, and recently o3-mini. Gemini models and GPT-4o mini haven’t worked well for me.

Some background. I’m a lawyer, not a programmer. But when ChatGPT first launched, I saw the potential of combining basic programming knowledge with LLMs to bring some side projects to life. So, over the last two years, I taught myself some Python. A few months ago, I decided to try building my first iOS app. I had ZERO experience with SwiftUI, so I relied entirely on ChatGPT. It was both fun and frustrating—especially because I had to manually copy-paste everything into Xcode.

Cursor will run through the fast credits pretty quickly, but it defaults to slow which is ok. Though the last 3 days it has been unusable for me due to a persistent error (also, they haven't fixed their error logging... It tells me it can't reach OpenAI even though I am using Anthropic models, and that's because they just never updated that message from when they only oofered OpenAI models).
