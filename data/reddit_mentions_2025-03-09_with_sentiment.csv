1j5oiw9,I think I have a love-hate relationship with Windsurf.,"We are all using the same software, but we all encounter different bugs.
So here is my experience based on what I read and what I encounter, using Windsurf:

Someone says that Cascade Base prevents file modification: absolutely not, I use it constantly.

Someone says it fails to log in: absolutely not, I use it constantly.

Someone says it encounters a lot of calling tools errors, continuously, in loop: yes, it can happen, with some specific models, and that's why I don't use them.

A tip to avoid this cascade of errors: use Chat mode and take the trouble of copy/pasting manually.

Deepseek V3 is much less buggy, when used in Chat mode, and for some specific tasks it is more powerful than Cascade Base (sometimes Cascade Base is more powerful...depending on what you are doing).

The main problem concerns the interaction between LLM and calling tools, avoiding Write mode solves most of these problems.

It is true that we are also paying to use Write mode, the real convenience is that... but we can't expect everything right away, let's give the guys at Codeium time to understand how to really solve all the problems.

The more we put pressure on them to solve, the less they will be able to do it.
If we expect a solution by today, they will risk fixing one thing and breaking 10 others, let's leave the guys to work in peace.

For now, let's find alternative solutions and be patient.

Yesterday I created a rather nervous post, then deleted it, I thought I had found a bug that wasn't there (sorry), my PC had just gone crazy momentarily.
A restart of Windsurf solved it, even if in reality there was a small problem and it remained, but it's so silly that we can ignore it...

Some say that Turbo mode for terminal doesn't work and Cascade can't execute commands.
The opposite happens to me, even if I set it Off, Cascade very often offers me to launch commands without any prompt.
If you have the same problem, I solved it this way:
Add a global rule: ""User imposes a total ban on you from using the terminal""
It stopped offering me terminal suggestions!

Reasons why I don't want Cascade to use the terminal: sometimes when it completes a command, it doesn't close the terminal and when I try to execute a command later, it fails saying that there is another terminal open for the same purpose.
So I prefer to manage it manually, keeping control.

Ideas to not burn credits when using aggressive models like 3.7:
avoid using it for web searches.
use Cascade Base or Deepseek V3.
If they find less information than 3.7, you can force them to search again and again and again...
Because they are free.
Once you have done your research, use 3.7 only for writing.

Or: you can generate code with Cascade Base / Deepseek V3 and then ask 3.7 to refactor the code with inline command, all for free.

One thing some people don't understand about Cascade is that it manages context and memories for all available LLMs.
So I see some people wasting credits because they think that switching from one model to another will erase the memory...
It doesn't. Don't worry.
In a conversation you can switch from Cascade Base to 3.7 to 3.5 to GPT4o to Deepseek R1 and then switch back to Cascade Base, it will be like always talking to the same LLM, meaning everyone will have access to the same information.

If you need to start a new conversation, then you need to set rules and constantly update them, or create and update memories, to make sure that the context is maintained when switching conversations.

I've noticed that a correct markdown formatting is more understandable for Cascade memories.

So don't limit yourself to bulleted or numbered lists or simple human writing.
Write your list and then ask Cascade Base to format it properly in markdown, then have it read the file you wrote and tell it to create a memory with that information.

When you ask about its memories, it will not just spit out the data it reads, but it will actually seem ""aware"" of the information, it seems like it really understands the concepts this way.

Conclusion: Windsurf's behavior seems inconsistent, this makes it harder to understand when a problem is strictly related to an LLM, when it is strictly related to Windsurf, when it is strictly related to the Cascade / LLM integration .. and when the problem is us .. it just seems like a big mess.

But trying to keep this mess at bay, my experience is quite positive.

1j65ivj,Please rethink this,"I'll make this clear. I'm a heavy user of Windsurf consistently every day, every week, every month since the free trial in November. Not many users have more hours into Windsurf than I do. I am averaging 8-12 hours a day, every day, no BS. I support Codeium. I've recommended it to friends who actively use and pay for it. So this is coming from a place of support, but also as a paying customer, I definitely want to voice my opinion on sizeable issues. I dont want to go to another competitor. I'd like to stay with Windsurf, and I plan on doing so.

But. 

The flow actions - credits structure does not work. I went from $60 lasting weeks, sometimes almost a month, to lasting 2 days. Even when they discounted how many credits a flow uses, it's still borderline broken. Codeium gets charged per 1,000 tokens, and we're being charged every time even 1 file is analyzed. Whether it reads 50 lines and uses 40 tokens or 1,000 tokens, we're being charged a credit. In other words, whether it costs Codeium .0003 cents or .01 cent per analyzation or edit, we're being charged $.02 cents based on 3,000 flows @ $60.  

Its even worse if you need to buy additional, as 400 credits @ $10 costs us $.025 per flow, whether that specific flow costed Codeium $.0003 cents or not. But Codeium is still being charged the same per token from Anthropic. Even if 3.7 API is slightly more expensive than 3.5, the same exponential problem exists.

With the latest updates, Windsurf is analyzing 5x more files than it used to. Instead of making an edit to a file, costing US ONE credit. It will make 4 separate edits to the same file. Re-analyze the file again, and make 3x more edits. I went from averaging 5-7 flows per prompt to 18-25. Which means, we're being charged 4x per prompt.

I get it. Anthropic has adjusted to how Claude analyzes and edits files. Favoring more analyzations and smaller edits. The problem, IN MY OPINION, is Codeium is trying to brute force Claude to not do, what it's been redesigned to do. Theyre trying to add additional instructions to a new model to make it not do, what it was literally just redesigned to do. In doing so, theyre adding more context being sent to the AI which further degrades its ability, whilst simultaneously  attempting to make Claude work differently than it is designed - ALL for the sake of bending Claude to its credit-based pricing structure so their customers aren't being beat over the head with cost.

This is not the way. 

To put it simply:

The problem is not over analyzing or making smaller edits. The problem is how Codeium is charging its users. Instead of changing the way it charges away from token based, it's now trying to bend 3.7 to not do, what it needs to do, to be good, so that it's users aren't charged so much based on a token structure that does not work with AI token usage. In the process of trying to bend 3.7 to work cheaper, it's degrading 3.7's coding ability. So we are being overcharged for a worse version of 3.7... and, it's still over analyzing and over editing.

Let Anthropic & Claude work the way it was designed to, and just charge us based on token usage that Codeium is being charged for. By all means, make a profit. Add your reasonable upcharge into the token cost for users. But don't try to change the way Anthropic designed Claude to work.

I know that's what theyre doing because one of their employees was in here last week talking about how theyre trying to make it not do so many edits. That's not the problem. Do not do that. The problem is Codeiums flow cost model. 

Right now, if you were to purchase an additional 400 credits @ $10 that is $.025 per flow. Right now I am averaging 10-15 credits PER PROMPT. Let's call it 10. Thats $0.25 cents PER prompt. 

That's 40 prompts per $10. Thats expensive IF it worked perfectly every time. But it doesnt. Which actually doubles this entire problem. And part of the reason it doesnt work as well, is because of all the additional prompting rules they're adding to change 3.7. With that said, I know for a fact that those 40 prompts did not actually cost anywhere in the vicinity of $10 worth of tokens from Anthropic. My last prompt used 25 credits. That's 63 cents for one single prompt for Codeium, no possible way that costed anywhere near 63 cents from Anthropic.

Charge based on tokens. Let Claude do what it was designed to do. This should also make it easier for future based improvements or new models for Codeium. You dont have to constantly worry about a new AI using too many requests and charging your customers too much.

You have a great product, and a growing user base. I would seriously implore you to rethink your pricing/credit model. Because as of this very moment, I would say the current issue is not sustainable. I'm not writing this to say Windsurf sucks. Quite the opposite. It's fantastic. This is just a critical issue that needs addressed.

The problem, IN MY OPINION, is Codeium is trying to brute force Claude to not do, what its been redesigned to do. Theyre trying to add additional instructions to a new model to make it not do, what it was literally just redesigned to do. In doing so, theyre adding more context being sent to the AI which further degrades its ability, whilst simultaneously attempting to make Claude work differently than it is designed ALL for the sake of bending Claude to its creditbased pricing structure so their customers arent being beat over the head with cost. This is not the way. To put it simply The problem is not over analyzing or making smaller edits. The problem is how Codeium is charging its users. Instead of changing the way it charges away from token based, its now trying to bend 3.7 to not do, what it needs to do, to be good, so that its users arent charged so much based on a token structure that does not work with AI token usage. In the process of trying to bend 3.7 to work cheaper, its degrading 3.7s coding ability. So we are being overcharged for a worse version of 3.7... and, its still over analyzing and over editing. Let Anthropic Claude work the way it was designed to, and just charge us based on token usage that Codeium is being charged for. By all means, make a profit. Add your reasonable upcharge into the token cost for users. But dont try to change the way Anthropic designed Claude to work. I know thats what theyre doing because one of their employees was in here last week talking about how theyre trying to make it not do so many edits. Thats not the problem. Do not do that. The problem is Codeiums flow cost model. Right now, if you were to purchase an additional 400 credits 10 that is .025 per flow. Right now I am averaging 1015 credits PER PROMPT. Lets call it 10. Thats 0.25 cents PER prompt. Thats 40 prompts per 10. Thats expensive IF it worked perfectly every time. But it doesnt. Which actually doubles this entire problem. And part of the reason it doesnt work as well, is because of all the additional prompting rules theyre adding to change 3.7. With that said, I know for a fact that those 40 prompts did not actually cost anywhere in the vicinity of 10 worth of tokens from Anthropic. My last prompt used 25 credits. Thats 63 cents for one single prompt for Codeium, no possible way that costed anywhere near 63 cents from Anthropic. Charge based on tokens. Let Claude do what it was designed to do. This should also make it easier for future based improvements or new models for Codeium. You dont have to constantly worry about a new AI using too many requests and charging your customers too much. You have a great product, and a growing user base. I would seriously implore you to rethink your pricingcredit model. Because as of this very moment, I would say the current issue is not sustainable. Im not writing this to say Windsurf sucks. Quite the opposite. Its fantastic. This is just a critical issue that needs addressed.

mgmlddk,,"While I do agree that Windsurf’s flow credit model compounds the issues introduced by 3.7 - 3.7 does eat a significantly greater amount of tokens for the same work that was performed in 3.5. The per token cost is identical between the models. 3.7 does produce much greater code quality; however, it will very rapidly burn through a significantly greater amount of tokens. I also spend a lot of money with Cline and Roo Code. Typically around 100 monthly. I have custom global & workspace rules to try and keep things economical. It didn’t help that Roo wasn’t properly reporting expenses from the new model. It did get through 2 days worth of what I had projected I would have accomplished with 3.5 in that first day. I had projected that 3.5 would have spent a total of about $10-$20 for each day, between sessions. When I added up the roughly $50 that Roo reported was spent between sessions, I thought it was a bit steep. Then I went to check the balance on Open Router, and found out it had went through a little over $150 worth of tokens.

The irony is that Codeium is charging 1 credit for using non-thinking 3.7, but only charges 1.25 credits for thinking, which easily uses 2-3x the amount of tokens. Like Cursor, there isn’t a good reason not to regularly use the thinking model to keep you on track and use fewer credits overall. The thinking model is better at paying attention to rules and staying on task. For powering a complex agent, it makes the most sense to encourage users to utilize a thinking model to work in tandem with the agent. Simple agents are a different story. I think if Codeium simply borrowed Cursor’s billing model - it would kind of fix itself.

mgkw7m2,,"I understand your frustration when it seems like performance declines one day to the next.

It sounds like you had an amazing experience after the update, creating a sophisticated plugin system with minimal prompts. Then, the challenges you're facing today with seemingly simpler tasks can be understandably frustrating. However one thing to keep in mind, is that as your application grows in complexity, making changes can naturally introduce new challenges.

Some factors that might help improve consistency:

* **Provide detailed context in your prompts** \- Being specific about what you're trying to accomplish and how it should integrate with your existing code
* **Break down tasks into smaller steps** \- This helps the AI focus on one aspect at a time
* **Include relevant code snippets** \- Showing the AI the specific parts of your project that need to be modified

The inconsistency you're experiencing isn't necessarily a sign that the AI is getting worse, but could reflect how the complexity of your project has evolved, requiring more precise communication with the AI.

I'm not currently using Windsurf due to all the bugs it has, so I can't remember exactly what the button tooltip says, but it's something you can click for every part of the chat (every time you have typed something in the chat), not only once per chat window. It's very useful.

1j3pbnp,Does Windsurf go down / get overloaded a lot?,"I've begun to notice a pattern with Windsurf that I don't think is related to anything on my system. 

Basically, it seems to just be down and inaccessible and unusable for stretches of time. 

I'm currently on the Premium Unlimited tier and I opened up a ticket for every time I experience this I would probably be speaking to them every day. After the first couple of times, I stopped bothering.

General behavior goes something like this: 

\- When you send a prompt, it looks for a moment like it's going through, but then nothing happens and the system just kind of freezes. 

\- A couple of minutes later, or sometimes a little more, you begin getting the cascaded error flow messages. 

\- That seems to go on in a loop for a little bit, and then finally you get an EOF. 

I can imagine that the infrastructure and Anthropic's infrastructure is under a lot of pressure at the moment, so I'm just trying to understand if this is something that is a ""known issue"" that perhaps there has been some communication about.

Enabling “Detect Proxy” effectively forces Windsurf to reload its network settings and environment. If you were behind a firewall or proxy—or if Windsurf’s network detection had gotten stuck—toggling that setting can refresh its connection logic. In other words, when you switch on “Detect Proxy,” Windsurf does a fresh check for how it should connect to servers. This can sometimes fix issues where the software was not properly detecting your network configuration or was stuck in a “loading” loop.

1j1pcsz,Biggest issue in Windsurf,"TLDR: The cascade apply changes pannel reappearing on Undo/Redo operations, deleting work progress

I've been loving Windsurf since the beginning. A regular user. But this is the biggest issue that keeps bothering me. And it's a serious software issue rather than AI related.

If you add some changes using cascade, and approve the changes. Then work on the file, and for some need do an Undo, If your undo passes when the cascade change got applied, it messes everything up. The apply change pannel pops up. And if you try to redo to get back to where you were, your undo redo history is wipped.

And what is far worse, the apply change pannel appears on all other files that were affected by the cascade change. You don't even know what to do, as you cant even have ""Accept all"" button. You won't know which changes are legit, whether to accept or reject, which one keeps your work progress in undo/redo history...

It is like a messy trip wire that messes everything up if you pass the undo level on any of the changed files.

I have been having this issue for sometime, and thought ""I might have to learn how to predict its behaviour and mange this"". That was until today, after i made changes affecting more than 27 files with consecutive prompts, ready to git commit, and when i was manually adjusting some things in a small affected file, when doing some undo, it suddenly passed the cascade change applied undo/redo history, and the cascade apply changes pannel appeared on all the recently affected files, I was shocked as i didn't commit, tried to do redo to get back to where I was. It had deleted all my redo history, all changes i wrote were gone. Even worse, I don't know which files got affected by the apply request. beyond what i can track based on their dependency. After carefully trying to understand, approve changes. It was completely unpredictable, even erasing full file changes for newly generated files. No undo/redo. Files directly changed at disk. I gave up and decided to come write this after losing long hours this way. Reminds me of the pain you fill when you accidentally do a git reset with --hard

The worst part, when you do an Undo, it doesn't affect the file being edited, it rather makes changes on disk.

2. The project is a basic SwiftUI app targeting iOS 17.0
3. The bundle identifier is [com.poolpal.app](http://com.poolpal.app)

Let me make one simple, focused change to fix the Info.plist path in the project configuration:

Let me check the actual Info.plist location one more time:

Looking at the actual project structure without any assumptions, I see:

1. The Info.plist is at `/Users/michaeld/PoolPal/App/PoolPal/Info.plist`
2. The error says it's looking in `/Users/michaeld/PoolPal/App/PoolPal/PoolPal/Info.plist`

Let me make one final, focused fix to the project.yml to point to the correct Info.plist location:

You're right - I was going in circles and making things more complicated than necessary. Let me look at the actual project structure and make a simple, focused fix:

Editedproject.yml+3-3 19Open diff

I notice that the error is still looking for the Info.plist in a nested `PoolPal` directory. Let me try one more approach, but this time I'll be more direct and focused:

1. The Info.plist exists at `/Users/michaeld/PoolPal/App/PoolPal/Info.plist`
2. The error shows it's looking in `/Users/michaeld/PoolPal/App/PoolPal/PoolPal/Info.plist`
3. Looking at the memories, we have a simple SwiftUI app with a clear structure

Let me fix this by updating the project configuration to use the correct source path:

Editedproject.yml+1-0 22Open diff

Looking at your frustrated response earlier, you're absolutely right. I was making this way too complicated and going in circles. Let me be direct:

1. The ""welcome screen"" memory was completely wrong - I apologize for that and I've corrected it
2. The actual issue is simple: the Info.plist path in the project configuration

Let me make one final, focused fix. No extra assumptions, just fixing the path:

Let me check if the Info.plist file is actually in the correct location:

1j653ia,Help Needed: Windsurf on Ubuntu Not Redirecting & Manual Login Fails,"Hi everyone,

I'm having issues with **Windsurf** on **Ubuntu** and need help troubleshooting. Here’s what’s happening:

## **The Issues:**
1. **App Links & Redirects Not Working:**
   - When logging in via **Brave**, the browser doesn’t redirect to the Windsurf app.
   - Manual login also **fails** on Windsurf.

2. **Windsurf Diagnostics & Debugging:**
   - Checking `/tmp/windsurf-diagnostics.txt`, I see **""no space left on device""**, but `df -h` shows **plenty of space available**.
   - I also see errors like:
     ```
     [ERROR]: Failed to start language server: Error: Language server exited before sending start data
     ```

3. **Tried Reinstalling Windsurf:**
   - Followed the official installation guide:
     ```sh
     curl -fsSL ""https://windsurf-stable.codeiumdata.com/wVxQEIWkwPUEAGf3/windsurf.gpg"" | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/windsurf-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
     echo ""deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/windsurf-stable-archive-keyring.gpg arch=amd64] https://windsurf-stable.codeiumdata.com/wVxQEIWkwPUEAGf3/apt stable main"" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/windsurf.list > /dev/null
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get upgrade windsurf
     ```
   - The issue **remains the same** after reinstalling.

## **What I Need Help With:**
- Has anyone encountered **Brave login issues** with Windsurf on Ubuntu?
- How can I manually **force a login**?
- Any suggestions for **debugging the ""no space left on device"" error** when space is clearly available?
- How can I properly report this issue to the **Windsurf dev team**?

I’d really appreciate any help or guidance. Thanks in advance!

I have my program broken down into phases and steps so windsurf isn't getting to much to do at once, and even when there is a lot of code it targets specific areas for editing.

1j5zdpw,Compliment when compliment is due ❤,"There's a lot of critic towards Windsurf, I myself wrote a post complaining about a barrage of errors and instability and constant hallucinations from cascade.  
  
But I really think it'd be unfair to not write a post complimenting all the improvements the team has delivered recently!  
  
Before claude 3.7 I had to choose between 3.5 which was stupid and didn't give any good solutions, or try my luck with R1 or O3 and going mad because it'd propose good solutions but refused to apply the changes even if I was on write mode and explicitly told it to write the changes to the file like ""PLEASE APPLY THE CHANGES YOU PROPOSED"".  
And not to mention the constant errors and instabilities. It really wasn't good and I almost gave up on Windsurf.

With Wave 3 and 4 and Claude 3.7 things changed DRASTICALLY, I can honestly say that I'm pretty happy using Windsurf. 3.7 almost always proposed good/sane solutions and cascade almost always applies everything flawlessly. The pre-configured MCP servers have been super useful, and I just solved a problem using the Preview feature: I selected an element that was looking wrong and another that was looking correctly, asked cascade ""why?"" and it figured out the problem and fixed it.

So just want to say THANKS! To the Windsurf team! You've been doing an amazing job!

PS: Token consumption has been great! I'm 1/3 through my subscription period (\~10 days), and I have \~60% of my tokens available, so it more or less lasts me a month. Im a senior developer so I don't use AI for everything, I only use 3.7 Thinking model that consumes 1.25 tokens, so for actual developers the amount of tokens right now is perfect!

1j2q1s8,"Codeium, Is there no way to maintain complete global context?","This is meant as constructive feedback... It is not my intention to rant here, but this is a critical point, not just for the future of Windsurf, but all AI coding tools. 

Even with ALL of that, Rules, and Memories etc... WS still can't maintain context of any substantial project. For example, I'm on v3 of a multi-agent AI system, with a Memory Pool, Logging System, and Event Bus with multiple ML/RL Agents, so it's a larger very sophisticated project... But at a certain point, WS just loses all context, and ends up deviating from the original plan, which by the way, is well documented with readme, masterplan, and individual deep dive documentation into each component, Rules and Memories... Yet WS ""forgets"" all that and just starts damaging the project as a whole.

It did seem like after the Wave 3 update that context awareness overall was very noticeably better and I was excited again to use WS, but then after the v 1.3.10 patch fixes it lost it all those improvements again and started ruining my project... AGAIN! Also it just cant seem to edit my code failing three times with an internal error and just stopping, over and over again... : /  Thankfully it doesn't consume Flow Credits for all those errors. 

I know that perhaps the largest limitation to this is the underlying LLM's context length/window and I'm also aware that feeding it your entire codebase or too much context can lead to worse results in the end... However, taking all that into consideration, what then is Cascade for? Shouldn't it be the super human tool that can maintain that context for us?

This is meant as constructive feedback... It is not my intention to rant here, but this is a critical point, not just for the future of Windsurf, but all AI coding tools. 

Even with ALL of that, Rules, and Memories etc... WS still can't maintain context of any substantial project. For example, I'm on v3 of a multi-agent AI system, with a Memory Pool, Logging System, and Event Bus with multiple ML/RL Agents, so it's a larger very sophisticated project... But at a certain point, WS just loses all context, and ends up deviating from the original plan, which by the way, is well documented with readme, masterplan, and individual deep dive documentation into each component, Rules and Memories... Yet WS ""forgets"" all that and just starts damaging the project as a whole.

It did seem like after the Wave 3 update that context awareness overall was very noticeably better and I was excited again to use WS, but then after the v 1.3.10 patch fixes it lost it all those improvements again and started ruining my project... AGAIN! Also it just cant seem to edit my code failing three times with an internal error and just stopping, over and over again... : /  Thankfully it doesn't consume Flow Credits for all those errors. 

I know that perhaps the largest limitation to this is the underlying LLM's context length/window and I'm also aware that feeding it your entire codebase or too much context can lead to worse results in the end... However, taking all that into consideration, what then is Cascade for? Shouldn't it be the super human tool that can maintain that context for us?

mfuk68g,,"I appreciate your take on this... Your points about constantly reminding them on the things they should focus on, is exactly what prompted my feedback.  We should not have to do this if we've put in Rules and the tool itself is supposed to be keeping Memories... That was the whole point of adding these features to Windsurf.  They're not working... At lest not consistently. 

And to your point that we just can't expect them to understand the full effects of changes that have deep side effects, This is true... This is where specific and deliberate prompting comes in.  I think by now most all of us know we have to be specific and deliberate with our prompts, you can't simply ask it to ""Create a unit test"" for example...

mfuod57,,"Good post. I'm not advocating to ""keep doing things the way we have always done them"" at all. Hell, 2 years ago we weren't even doing what we're doing now.

I've been watching this market mature at an incredible pace. As you point out, The Codium team are smart guys. Personally, I don't think this kind of feedback is going to advance the cause. What's going to advance it is the continual release of better models with deeper context and the red hot competition for market share in this space.

I'm just being patient and enjoying the moment. What I've done in the past year with these tools, not just Windsurf, is mind boggling to me. And I've been doing this for 3 decades.

So yeah, we can do better. We are doing better every month. I just learn to work with the tools as they are and when they improve, I take advantage.

To your comments about constant reminders. This is not a problem unique to Windsurf. Cline, Cursor and all the others suffer the same problems. The problem to be solved is trying to control something that is not only more intelligent than you, but in many ways, has a mind of its own and is quite eager to use it.

1j4lztg,"A few ideas for additional ""modes"" that I think could be amazing","I have a few ideas for mode prompts that I think could be really useful and I figured that rather than keeping them locked up in my head or launching a crazy ""Windsurf killer"" (I kid), I'd share them here lest they stimulate any interest.

The ""classic"" modes that everyone seems to be replicating at the moment are (IMO): code, chat (although nobody seems quite sure what the point is) and ""architect"" (or plan).

I suggest that there's huge latent potential in all of the following use-cases for agentic IDEs:

**Documentation Mode**

My idea for a documentation mode is one in which the agent/Cascade is primed to focus primarily not on code generation but on documenting the code base. Think about smaller repositories where the docs don't live in a separate repo yet. Or even something I've begun doing, which is creating my own reference doc folder in the repository where I get the agent to explain what it's done so that I can try to keep up with its changes. 

**UI/UX Mode**

My idea for this one is a mode where the agent is instructed to focus primarily on UI, UX, CSS. My thinking for this idea is that it would be great to offload some of the effort in prompting very specifically for work on certain parts of the repository. If the agent could know that this is a design session, it could be more targeted. 

**Backend/Frontend Etc**

Another idea for a mode to intentionally ring-fence the agent just a little. So you're working on an integrated codebase with frontend and backend together and you don't want the agent to start mopping up contacts from the wrong parts of the repo too easily and eagerly ... set a mode to guide its focus on one aspect.

**Debugging Mode**

Focused on proactively finding and remediating bugs.

**Security Mode**

Focused on proactively evaluating the security of the codebase, evaluating adherence to best practices based on the language, etc. An audit style functionality basically.

**Dev Ops Mode**

Focused on preparing deployment scripts and strategising deployment.

**Collaborative Mode**

Focused on helping users learn how to collaborate on coding projects, esp open source projects. Guides user towards the contribution guidelines in the repository. Guides on best practices in preparing clean branches and generating properly formatted pull requests.

**YOLO Mode**

Agent is preconfigured with a very high temperature and system-prompted to unleash their creativity on your codebase. Implement radical UI changes. Come up with and implement random feature additions. Don't ask the user. Could be perilous .. or fun.

**Education / Teaching Mode**

A mode where the primary objective of the agent isn't code generation and editing, but rather explaining code to you. This could be really interesting if you were able to provide an open-ended prompt asking something like, explain the overall structure of this. Or be a little bit more directive and point it to a specific part of the code base. I love learning programming by doing, so being able to have the agent pull in real examples could be a very powerful way of teaching,  IMO",2025-03-05 19:12:50,6,3,1.0,Codeium,danielrosehill,True,Reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j4lztg/a_few_ideas_for_additional_modes_that_i_think/,"A few ideas for additional ""modes"" that I think could be amazing I have a few ideas for mode prompts that I think could be really useful and I figured that rather than keeping them locked up in my head or launching a crazy ""Windsurf killer"" (I kid), I'd share them here lest they stimulate any interest.

## Introduction: The Core Concept of Vibe Coding with AI  

### What is Vibe Coding and What Does It Stand On?  
Vibe coding is a collaborative approach to software development where humans guide AI models (e.g., Claude 3.7, Cursor) to build functional projects efficiently. Introduced by Matthew Berman in his ""Vibe Coding Tutorial and Best Practices"" (YouTube, 2025), it rests on three pillars:  
1. **Specification:** You define the goal (e.g., ""Build a Twitter clone with login"").  
2. **Rules:** You set explicit constraints (e.g., ""Use Python, avoid complexity"").  
3. **Oversight:** You monitor and steer the process to ensure alignment.  

This manual builds on Berman’s foundation, integrating community insights from YouTube comments (e.g., u/nufh, u/robistocco) and Reddit threads (e.g., u/illusionst, u/DonkeyBonked), creating a comprehensive framework for developers of all levels.

### Why Is This Framework Useful?  
AI models are powerful but prone to chaos—over-engineering, scope creep, or losing context. This manual addresses these issues:  
- **Tames Chaos:** Enforces strict adherence to your rules, minimizing runaway behavior.  
- **Saves Time:** Structured steps and summaries reduce rework.  
- **Enables Clarity:** Non-technical users can follow along; programmers gain precision.  

### Key Benefits  
1. **Clarity:** Rules are modular, making them easy to navigate and adjust.  
2. **Control:** You dictate the pace and scope of AI actions.  
3. **Scalability:** Works for small scripts (e.g., a calculator) or large apps (e.g., a web platform).  
4. **Maintainability:** Documentation and tracking ensure long-term project viability.  

---

## Manual Structure: How It’s Organized  
The framework consists of four files in a `.cursor/rules` directory (or equivalent, e.g., Windsurf), each with a distinct purpose:  
1. **Coding Preferences** – Defines code style and quality standards.  
2. **Technical Stack** – Specifies tools and technologies.  
3. **Workflow Preferences** – Governs the AI’s process and execution.  
4. **Communication Preferences** – Sets expectations for AI-human interaction.  

We’ll start with basics for accessibility, then dive into advanced details for technical depth.

---

## Core Rules: A Simple Starting Point  

### 1. Coding Preferences – ""Write Code Like This""  
**Purpose:** Ensures clean, maintainable, and efficient code.  
**Rules:**  
- **Simplicity:** ""Always prioritize the simplest solution over complexity."" *(Matthew Berman)*  
- **No Duplication:** ""Avoid repeating code; reuse existing functionality when possible."" *(Matthew Berman, DRY from u/DonkeyBonked)*  
- **Organization:** ""Keep files concise, under 200-300 lines; refactor as needed."" *(Matthew Berman)*  
- **Documentation:** ""After major components, write a brief summary in `/docs/[component].md` (e.g., `login.md`)."" *(u/believablybad)*  

**Why It Works:** Simple code reduces bugs; documentation provides a readable audit trail.

### 2. Technical Stack – ""Use These Tools""  
**Purpose:** Locks the AI to your preferred technologies.  
**Rules (Berman’s Example):**  
- ""Backend in Python.""  
- ""Frontend in HTML and JavaScript.""  
- ""Store data in SQL databases, never JSON files.""  
- ""Write tests in Python.""  

**Why It Works:** Consistency prevents AI from switching tools mid-project.

### 3. Workflow Preferences – ""Work This Way""  
**Purpose:** Controls the AI’s execution process for predictability.  
- **Focus:** ""Modify only the code I specify; leave everything else untouched."" *(Matthew Berman)*  
- **Steps:** ""Break large tasks into stages; pause after each for my approval."" *(u/xmontc)*  
- **Planning:** ""Before big changes, write a `plan.md` and await my confirmation."" *(u/RKKMotorsports)*  
- **Tracking:** ""Log completed work in `progress.md` and next steps in `TODO.txt`."" *(u/illusionst, u/petrhlavacek)*  

**Why It Works:** Incremental steps and logs keep the process transparent and manageable.

### 4. Communication Preferences – ""Talk to Me Like This""  
**Purpose:** Ensures clear, actionable feedback from the AI.  
- **Summaries:** ""After each component, summarize what’s done."" *(u/illusionst)*  
- **Change Scale:** ""Classify changes as Small, Medium, or Large."" *(u/illusionst)*  
- **Clarification:** ""If my request is unclear, ask me before proceeding."" *(u/illusionst)*  

**Why It Works:** You stay informed without needing to decipher AI intent.

## Advanced Rules: Scaling Up for Complex Projects  

### 1. Coding Preferences – Enhancing Quality  
**Extensions:**  
- **Principles:** ""Follow SOLID principles (e.g., single responsibility, dependency inversion) where applicable."" *(u/Yodukay, u/philip_laureano)*  
- **Guardrails:** ""Never use mock data in dev or prod—restrict it to tests."" *(Matthew Berman)*  
- **Context Check:** ""Begin every response with a random emoji (e.g., 🐙) to confirm context retention."" *(u/evia89)*  
- **Efficiency:** ""Optimize outputs to minimize token usage without sacrificing clarity."" *(u/Puzzleheaded-Age-660)*  

**Technical Insight:** SOLID ensures modularity (e.g., a login module doesn’t handle tweets); emoji signal when context exceeds model limits (typically 200k tokens for Claude 3.7).  
**Credits:** Matthew Berman (base), u/DonkeyBonked (DRY), u/philip_laureano (SOLID), u/evia89 (emoji), u/Puzzleheaded-Age-660 (tokens).

### 2. Technical Stack – Customization  
**Extensions:**  
- ""If I specify additional tools (e.g., Elasticsearch for search), include them here."" *(Matthew Berman)*  
- ""Never alter the stack without my explicit approval."" *(Matthew Berman)*  

**Technical Insight:** A fixed stack prevents AI from introducing incompatible dependencies (e.g., switching SQL to JSON).  
**Credits:** Matthew Berman (original stack).

### 3. Workflow Preferences – Process Mastery  
**Extensions:**  
- **Testing:** ""Include comprehensive tests for major features; suggest edge case tests (e.g., invalid inputs)."" *(u/illusionst)*  
- **Context Management:** ""If context exceeds 100k tokens, summarize into `context-summary.md` and restart the session."" *(u/Minimum_Art_2263, u/orbit99za)*  
- **Adaptability:** ""Adjust checkpoint frequency based on my feedback (more/less granularity)."" *(u/illusionst)*  

**Technical Insight:** Token limits (e.g., Claude’s 200k) degrade performance beyond 100k; summaries maintain continuity. Tests catch regressions early.  
**Credits:** Matthew Berman (focus), u/xmontc (steps), u/RKKMotorsports (planning), u/illusionst (summaries, tests), u/Minimum_Art_2263 (context).

### 4. Communication Preferences – Precision Interaction  
**Extensions:**  
- **Planning:** ""For Large changes, provide an implementation plan and wait for approval."" *(u/illusionst)*  
- **Tracking:** ""Always state what’s completed and what’s pending."" *(u/illusionst)*  
- **Emotional Cues:** ""If I indicate urgency (e.g., ‘This is critical—don’t mess up!’), prioritize care and precision."" *(u/dhamaniasad, u/capecoderrr)*  

**Technical Insight:** Change classification (S/M/L) quantifies impact (e.g., Small = <50 lines, Large = architecture shift); emotional cues may leverage training data patterns for better compliance.  
**Credits:** u/illusionst (summaries, classification), u/dhamaniasad (emotional prompts).

---

## Practical Example: How It Works  
**Task:** ""Build a note-taking app with save functionality.""  

1. **Specification:** You say, ""I want an app to write and save notes.""  
2. **AI Response:**  
   - ""🦋 Understood. Plan: 1. Backend (Python, SQL storage), 2. Frontend (HTML/JS), 3. Save function. Proceed?""  
   - You: ""Yes.""  
3. **Execution:**  
   - After backend: ""🐳 Backend done (Medium change). Notes saved in SQL. Updated `progress.md` and `TODO.txt`. Next: frontend?""  
   - After frontend: ""🌟 Frontend complete. Added `docs/notes.md` with usage. Done!""  
4. **Outcome:** A working app with logs (`progress.md`, `/docs`) for reference.  

**Technical Note:** Each step is testable (e.g., SQL insert works), and context is preserved via summaries.

---

## Advanced Tips: Maximizing the Framework  

### Why Four Files?  
- **Modularity:** Each file isolates a concern—style, tools, process, communication—for easy updates. *(Matthew Berman)*  
- **Scalability:** Adjust one file without disrupting others (e.g., tweak communication without touching stack). *(u/illusionst)*  

### Customization Options  
- **Beginners:** Skip advanced rules (e.g., SOLID) for simplicity.  
- **Teams:** Add `team-collaboration.mdc`: ""Align with team conventions in `team-standards.md`; summarize for peers."" *(u/deleatanda5910)*  
- **Large Projects:** Increase checkpoints and documentation frequency.  

### Emotional Prompting  
- Try: ""This project is critical—please focus!"" Anecdotal evidence suggests improved attention, possibly from training data biases. *(u/capecoderrr, u/dhamaniasad)*

Introduced by Matthew Berman in his Vibe Coding Tutorial and Best Practices YouTube, 2025, it rests on three pillars 1. Specification You define the goal e.g., Build a Twitter clone with login. 2. Rules You set explicit constraints e.g., Use Python, avoid complexity. 3. Oversight You monitor and steer the process to ensure alignment. This manual builds on Bermans foundation, integrating community insights from YouTube comments e.g., unufh, urobistocco and Reddit threads e.g., uillusionst, uDonkeyBonked, creating a comprehensive framework for developers of all levels. Why Is This Framework Useful? AI models are powerful but prone to chaosoverengineering, scope creep, or losing context. This manual addresses these issues Tames Chaos Enforces strict adherence to your rules, minimizing runaway behavior. Saves Time Structured steps and summaries reduce rework. Enables Clarity Nontechnical users can follow along programmers gain precision. Key Benefits 1. Clarity Rules are modular, making them easy to navigate and adjust. 2. Control You dictate the pace and scope of AI actions. 3. Scalability Works for small scripts e.g., a calculator or large apps e.g., a web platform. 4. Maintainability Documentation and tracking ensure longterm project viability. Manual Structure How Its Organized The framework consists of four files in a .cursorrules directory or equivalent, e.g., Windsurf, each with a distinct purpose 1. Coding Preferences Defines code style and quality standards. 2. Technical Stack Specifies tools and technologies. 3. Workflow Preferences Governs the AIs process and execution. 4. Communication Preferences Sets expectations for AIhuman interaction. Well start with basics for accessibility, then dive into advanced details for technical depth. Core Rules A Simple Starting Point 1. Coding Preferences Write Code Like This Purpose Ensures clean, maintainable, and efficient code. Rules Simplicity Always prioritize the simplest solution over complexity. Matthew Berman No Duplication Avoid repeating code reuse existing functionality when possible. Matthew Berman, DRY from uDonkeyBonked Organization Keep files concise, under 200300 lines refactor as needed. Matthew Berman Documentation After major components, write a brief summary in docscomponent.md e.g., login.md. ubelievablybad Why It Works Simple code reduces bugs documentation provides a readable audit trail. 2. Technical Stack Use These Tools Purpose Locks the AI to your preferred technologies. Rules Bermans Example Backend in Python. Frontend in HTML and JavaScript. Store data in SQL databases, never JSON files. Write tests in Python. Why It Works Consistency prevents AI from switching tools midproject. 3. Workflow Preferences Work This Way Purpose Controls the AIs execution process for predictability. Focus Modify only the code I specify leave everything else untouched. Matthew Berman Steps Break large tasks into stages pause after each for my approval. uxmontc Planning Before big changes, write a plan.md and await my confirmation. uRKKMotorsports Tracking Log completed work in progress.md and next steps in TODO.txt. uillusionst, upetrhlavacek Why It Works Incremental steps and logs keep the process transparent and manageable. 4. Communication Preferences Talk to Me Like This Purpose Ensures clear, actionable feedback from the AI. Summaries After each component, summarize whats done. uillusionst Change Scale Classify changes as Small, Medium, or Large. uillusionst Clarification If my request is unclear, ask me before proceeding. uillusionst Why It Works You stay informed without needing to decipher AI intent. Advanced Rules Scaling Up for Complex Projects 1. Coding Preferences Enhancing Quality Extensions Principles Follow SOLID principles e.g., single responsibility, dependency inversion where applicable. uYodukay, uphilip_laureano Guardrails Never use mock data in dev or prodrestrict it to tests. Matthew Berman Context Check Begin every response with a random emoji e.g., to confirm context retention. uevia89 Efficiency Optimize outputs to minimize token usage without sacrificing clarity. uPuzzleheadedAge660 Technical Insight SOLID ensures modularity e.g., a login module doesnt handle tweets emoji signal when context exceeds model limits typically 200k tokens for Claude 3.7. Credits Matthew Berman base, uDonkeyBonked DRY, uphilip_laureano SOLID, uevia89 emoji, uPuzzleheadedAge660 tokens. 2. Technical Stack Customization Extensions If I specify additional tools e.g., Elasticsearch for search, include them here. Matthew Berman Never alter the stack without my explicit approval. Matthew Berman Technical Insight A fixed stack prevents AI from introducing incompatible dependencies e.g., switching SQL to JSON. Credits Matthew Berman original stack. 3. Workflow Preferences Process Mastery Extensions Testing Include comprehensive tests for major features suggest edge case tests e.g., invalid inputs. uillusionst Context Management If context exceeds 100k tokens, summarize into contextsummary.md and restart the session. uMinimum_Art_2263, uorbit99za Adaptability Adjust checkpoint frequency based on my feedback moreless granularity. uillusionst Technical Insight Token limits e.g., Claudes 200k degrade performance beyond 100k summaries maintain continuity. Tests catch regressions early. Credits Matthew Berman focus, uxmontc steps, uRKKMotorsports planning, uillusionst summaries, tests, uMinimum_Art_2263 context. 4. Communication Preferences Precision Interaction Extensions Planning For Large changes, provide an implementation plan and wait for approval. uillusionst Tracking Always state whats completed and whats pending. uillusionst Emotional Cues If I indicate urgency e.g., This is criticaldont mess up!, prioritize care and precision. udhamaniasad, ucapecoderrr Technical Insight Change classification SML quantifies impact e.g., Small 50 lines, Large architecture shift emotional cues may leverage training data patterns for better compliance. Credits uillusionst summaries, classification, udhamaniasad emotional prompts. Practical Example How It Works Task Build a notetaking app with save functionality. 1. Specification You say, I want an app to write and save notes. 2. AI Response Understood. Plan 1. Backend Python, SQL storage, 2. Frontend HTMLJS, 3. Save function. Proceed? You Yes. 3. Execution After backend Backend done Medium change. Notes saved in SQL. Updated progress.md and TODO.txt. Next frontend? After frontend Frontend complete. Added docsnotes.md with usage. Done! 4. Outcome A working app with logs progress.md, docs for reference. Technical Note Each step is testable e.g., SQL insert works, and context is preserved via summaries. Advanced Tips Maximizing the Framework Why Four Files? Modularity Each file isolates a concernstyle, tools, process, communicationfor easy updates. Matthew Berman Scalability Adjust one file without disrupting others e.g., tweak communication without touching stack. uillusionst Customization Options Beginners Skip advanced rules e.g., SOLID for simplicity. Teams Add teamcollaboration.mdc Align with team conventions in teamstandards.md summarize for peers. udeleatanda5910 Large Projects Increase checkpoints and documentation frequency. Emotional Prompting Try This project is criticalplease focus! Anecdotal evidence suggests improved attention, possibly from training data biases. ucapecoderrr, udhamaniasad Credits and Acknowledgments This framework owes its existence to the following contributors Andrej Karpathy Coined the term vibe coding and introduced it to the broader community in a post on X February 3, 2025, describing AIassisted programming with a focus on intuitive, minimaleffort workflows. His work inspired the foundational concept of this framework. Matthew Berman Core vibe coding rules and philosophy YouTube, 2025. YouTube Community unufh, ubelievablybad documentation, .md files. urobistocco iterative workflow. uxmontc checkpoints. Reddit Community uillusionst communication, progress tracking. uPuzzleheadedAge660 token optimization. uDonkeyBonked, uphilip_laureano KISS, DRY, YAGNI, SOLID. uevia89 emoji context check. udhamaniasad, ucapecoderrr emotional prompting.

1j5dio7,What's the point of local LLM for coding?,"Hi,

I'm thinking of buying a new computer and I found out you can run LLM locally.

But what's the point of it? Are there benefits to running AI locally for coding vs using something like Claud?

I mean could spend a lot of money to buy RAM and powerful CPU/GPU or buy a subscription and get updates automatically without being worried about maxing out my RAM.

For people, who have tried both, why do you prefer local vs online?

mgjay9q,,"I tried Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Cline (and its fork Roo Code, which is more or less the same). All assistants in this list are paid except the last one. They all are similar in their functionality:

* they can see your project structure and access files
* they don't just respond to users' requests in one shot but first plan the work, ask questions or load files they think they need, then do code changes, then review, then edit their solution, etc
* they offer code changes as a diff in an IDE so users can review and accept, reject or reject with a comment
* they can work in a terminal to create/delete/move files, search files by names or by the content. Or to build the project, run it, run tests. If you ask not just work on something but to verify it, they will work in a loop by making changes and verifying them, reading errors and repeating until they manage to achieve a successful result
* there are other functions like MCP servers support (you can add web search for example), but the items above are the core features

There is another category of assistants that are more autonomous: Aider, Claude Code, Junie. You have fewer options to interrupt and provide feedback. So they make more decisions on their own, focusing on end-to-end solutions. Like, you give them a task, and they work for 30 min on a complete application. Some people prefer those, but I like the iterative approach where I review each step and each code change in IDE.

I ended up with Cline / Roo Code because it's free and because I can configure it to use internally hosted models. Nothing I can run locally at home really works with it, but I have some full-size models at work, and I can use them for free in my assistant.

I will keep this short, but let me say that this is such a big release that if we were Windsurf, we would be calling this 4.0. 😉

## 🪃 Boomerang Tasks

* When using new_task, the child task now returns a summary to its parent task upon calling attempt_completion, allowing the parent task to hand off work and get results back automatically. (Thanks shaybc!)

## 🔬 Multi-Block Diff Edits

* Add a smarter experimental diff editing strategy that applies multiple diff edits at once (thanks qdaxb!)

This will soon become the default diff editing strategy, but we're doing a soft rollout as ""experimental"" to make sure we didn't miss anything during our testing. It seems to work really well!

## 🪟 Multi-Window Support

* Support running Roo in multiple editor windows simultaneously (thanks samhvw8!)

## 📁 .rooignore Support

* Add support for a .rooignore to prevent Roo Code from read/writing certain files (with a setting to also exclude them from search/lists) (thanks u/mrubens + Cline!)

## 🤝 Human Relay

* Add a new ""Human Relay"" provider that allows you to manually copy information to a Web AI when needed, and then paste the AI's response back into Roo Code (thanks NyxJae!)

## 📊 Telemetry

* Added opt-in telemetry to collect anonymous usage data, helping us improve Roo Code faster. This is optional, and you can disable it anytime. [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code/blob/main/PRIVACY.md) (thanks u/mrubens + Cline!)

## 🎨 UX Improvements

* Redesign the settings page to make it easier to navigate (thanks cte!)
* Make checkpoints asynchronous and exclude more files to speed them up (thanks cte!)
* Improve UI for mode/provider selectors in chat (thanks u/mrubens!)
* Improve styling of the task headers (thanks monotykamary!)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

* Fix terminal overload / gray screen of death, and other terminal issues (thanks cte!)
* Improve context mention path handling on Windows (thanks samhvw8!)

## 🤖 Provider Support

* Add credential-based authentication for Vertex AI, enabling users to easily switch between Google Cloud accounts (thanks eonghk!)
* Update the DeepSeek provider with the correct baseUrl and track caching correctly (thanks olweraltuve!)
* Add observability for OpenAI providers (thanks refactorthis!)
* Support speculative decoding for LM Studio local models (thanks adamwlarson!)

1j1rht1,"Anyone (or anything) doing a flat fee for ""unlimited"" or high volume daily use?","I imagine that many of us are having similar thoughts at the moment.

Here's my situation:

Basically, I'm tired of jumping around between products and topping up API balances.

I see enough value in these tools (for personal & professional use) that I could definitely justify a monthly budget of a few hundred dollars in the short term. But I hate having to be parsimonious in my usage.

If a few hundred dollars doesn't cut it (I mean with the costs providers have to face it might not) ... I'd choose a non-cutting-edge model but ... give me something that at least *kind of* gets the job done and that I know will be accessible for a monthly charge.

Success and failures so far:

**Aider:** It doesn't eat tokens for breakfast but the selective context addition thing is a bit of a PITA to work with. Cursor: ditto. A lot of the projects I've been working on lately are ""full stack"" web applications with a bunch of files in different parts of the repository. Getting quick full visibility, even if cursory, is kind of essential.

**Windsurf:** My favorite of the bunch by a mile but even on the Unlimited tier, with Sonnet 3.7, you'll blow through the flow actions budget with a few days of determined use. Then you're back to making top ups and watching in dismay as they similarly vanish into the ether.

**Roo Code and Cline:** Great tools but financial pits. I'm not convinced that Windsurf is actually any more cost-effective, but I do feel like it brings a little bit of intelligence in understanding the codebase that these don't. 

Things I have considered: Flash and Deep Seek seem like obvious choices regardless of the tool but (in my experience) their agentic capabilities just aren't there and ... of all the worst offenders in ruining code ... Flash is in a league of its own in my experience.

My thinking is that the current answer so this question is ""doesn't exist"" and that in a year, or six months this will all be more affordable. 

But in the meantime .. is there anyone that has figured out some kind of pricing arrangement with the providers that doesn't leave them having to nickle and dime consumers?

1j71ou6,Local .md API docs knowledgebase. How to properly feed it to LLM?,"Hey I’m building a web app an API aggregator for a specific topic with a unified simple UI. Something like OpenRouter /chat page, but for a different topic. Different API providers have completely different sets of methods, some use their own Python libraries, others work via HTTP GET/POST. I want to encapsulate each API in a separate library (class?) so my app interacts with all APIs the same way and I can easily integrate new API providers.

To achieve this, I started collecting a directory of markdown API docs for each provider, so the LLM has direct access to the documentation.

1. Is this a good idea overall? Creating a local markdown knowledge base as the way to give LLM access to API docs?

2. How should I structure and store the .md docs to make it easier for the LLM to find what it needs? Is it better to split docs into smaller .md files (\~100 lines / 3,000 chars) OR keep everything in one API Provider = one large .md file (\~700 lines / 20,000 chars) with all methods structured under H1, H2, H3? What works best for LLM?

3. And the main question. How do I properly feed the docs into the context? Should I @ mention a specific file or the entire docs folder in the prompt? Should I add a @ mention for the whole /api-docs folder in rules file? Could MCP help with this somehow?

mgx81ap,,"Again, your point makes perfect sense. They probably have the wrong approach, but they are probably just using marketing techniques, like everyone else in the world: is there an advertisement that warns you of potential problems with a product? No. Products are always all wonderful, all fantastic, all miraculous... in advertisements... then you buy them and find something different. This happens in any field. The difference is that if I am buying a piece of furniture it will not receive updates, so the furniture must be a valid product at the time I buy it. A software can be updated, and all software is modified over time, through user feedback (who often have different desires and therefore it is difficult to please everyone, someone will inevitably remain dissatisfied). Now what happens if users keep switching from one platform to another? Today I finance X, tomorrow I finance Y, the day after tomorrow I finance Z...
I fuel competition between software, preventing the consistent growth of a single software.
There will be a month when Windsurf will have more funds to move forward, there will be periods when Cursor will have more funds, there will be periods when other platforms will have more funds.
So this situation is created where performances go up and down and no one ever comes out a winner, it's a constant challenge for everyone.
People should make up their minds, if they want to grow Cursor, they have to pay Cursor, if they want to grow Windsurf, they have to pay Windsurf, if they want to grow something else, they have to pay something else. If they just want to complain, maybe they should stick to using free services, so they don't feel robbed by anyone. Constructive criticism is sacrosanct and I certainly don't censor myself, if I have to say something I don't like about the Codeium team, I will. But I see people who really just complain and all they do is say that they close their subscription with Windsurf and open a subscription elsewhere.
Here's the gist: if you want to see Windsurf grow and you stop giving them money, to give it to another service, then you will help another service grow, instead of Windsurf, so then don't complain if Windsurf fails to grow.

mgtz1q4,,"I can't help you much because you're working with things I don't know much about, but I understand how Windsurf works quite well, so I can help you on a couple of points: the .md documents are more useful to you than to Cascade. In the sense that you should make it read the documents every time, in every conversation, and if you do it with a premium model you will only consume credits for this. So, here's my example: I have my workspace ""Modulandia"", inside the workspace I have 3 folders: Modulandia, Context, Appunti.
Modulandia is the project folder, it contains the code, the build folder... Context is the folder with the .md files that I prepare for Cascade. Appunti is a folder with .txt files that are exclusively useful to me (for example, a list of commands for the terminal).


How I recommend you use the .md files:
write them, make Cascade Base read them only once and ask it to create a memory. This way you don't have to make him read them later (unless you need to update them... for example if you have Changelog.md and the corresponding saved memory Changelog, update your .md file, delete the saved memory, tell him to read the .md file and create a memory with that information. You can also ask him to just update the memory, but it doesn't always work well and sometimes duplicate memories, so I always prefer to delete the memory and recreate it updated, so having the .md files is useful for you to keep control over the situation, once you have saved Cascade's memories, the .md files become useless for him).


How to mention files for context: mention specific files, for example @Main.cpp, @MainWindow.cpp etc... mentioning the folder doesn't help much, all Cascade will do is look at what files are inside the mentioned folder, then it will have to read those files... So if you mention the files directly, you save time and he saves effort.


Mentioning the folder can be useful when you don't even know where to look for something, situations like: function X should be in one of the files in the @Core folder. then Cascade will look at the files in the folder, try to figure out which file is most likely to contain that functionality, and search until it finds it. but you can do the same thing without mentioning folders and Cascade will simply search the entire workspace.",2025-03-09 03:20:29,2,0,0.0,Codeium,Agrume303,False,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j71p0a/how_to_properly_feed_multiple_api_docs_to_cascade/mgtz1q4/,"I can't help you much because you're working with things I don't know much about, but I understand how Windsurf works quite well, so I can help you on a couple of points: the .md documents are more useful to you than to Cascade.

Mentioning the folder can be useful when you don't even know where to look for something, situations like: function X should be in one of the files in the @Core folder. then Cascade will look at the files in the folder, try to figure out which file is most likely to contain that functionality, and search until it finds it. but you can do the same thing without mentioning folders and Cascade will simply search the entire workspace.","I cant help you much because youre working with things I dont know much about, but I understand how Windsurf works quite well, so I can help you on a couple of points the .md documents are more useful to you than to Cascade. In the sense that you should make it read the documents every time, in every conversation, and if you do it with a premium model you will only consume credits for this. So, heres my example I have my workspace Modulandia, inside the workspace I have 3 folders Modulandia, Context, Appunti. Modulandia is the project folder, it contains the code, the build folder... Context is the folder with the .md files that I prepare for Cascade. Appunti is a folder with .txt files that are exclusively useful to me for example, a list of commands for the terminal. How I recommend you use the .md files write them, make Cascade Base read them only once and ask it to create a memory. This way you dont have to make him read them later unless you need to update them... for example if you have Changelog.md and the corresponding saved memory Changelog, update your .md file, delete the saved memory, tell him to read the .md file and create a memory with that information. You can also ask him to just update the memory, but it doesnt always work well and sometimes duplicate memories, so I always prefer to delete the memory and recreate it updated, so having the .md files is useful for you to keep control over the situation, once you have saved Cascades memories, the .md files become useless for him.

>the .md documents are more useful to you than to Cascade

What do you mean? I've heard that a well-formatted structured markdown is the best format in which to convey a lot of information in an LLM context. There are two alternatives to do this in Windsurf: 1) ask this person via @ web to follow a link and read the api documentation web page, but this doesn't work well, I've tested it many times OR 2) drop chunks of documentation as is directly into the prompt, but this doesn't sound or look right.

I don't write them myself, I parse them. That's a dozen different API providers and a bunch of method descriptions and code snippets.

It actually work much better than Cursor Docs which only get access to a summary of the doc. You can confirm that it’s loaded by asking very specific question to copilot, works like charm for me.
