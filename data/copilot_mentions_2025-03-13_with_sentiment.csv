1inrerx,please help me I'm going insane,"EDIT: SOLVED!!



I have been trying to sign in to GitHub from vscode for about two weeks now and to no avail

I believe I have tried everything, searched the web for similar issues but for the first time no one had a similar issue, I have tried every AI chat there is, Gpt, deep seek, even copilot on github's website but nothing.

the issue looks very simple which is why it has dumbfounded me so much.

here's how it goes: vscode says I have to sign in to github to use associated features like copilot or to save my code in a repository, but when I do a pop up appears on the bottom right that says signing in to github.

I have stared at this pop up for longer than I can admit.

eventually after a couple minutes it says I haven't finished configuring the authenticator extension or something and says it will try to sign in using a local host, another half an hour and after it fails, gives me a code to past on the website to sign in, I do that and it says your all set, returning to vs code reveals that I am indeed not all set. as it gives me an ""Error signing in to github"" ""try again"" in a smug way

at first I thought nothing of it and it wasn't a big deal until a couple of days ago when I lost a big chunk of a project I've been working on for my collage

I'm so frustrated with every thing about this as no one seems to relate and I feel like the only one with this issue

I saw a post on stackoverflow for someone with what he described to be a similar issue to mine but no one seemed to know why and no solution to the problem was posted

here's a bunch of things I tried to do but didn't work

1. I'm working from home so no firewall or vpn or anything similar to try and block the extension I think.
2. tried to manually sign in using github from the terminal by configuring my user name and email. still nothing.
3. cleared any previous credentials stored on the extension if there was any since it didn't work once. nope. not it.
4. uninstall and reinstall, multiple times, nah.
5. use the token, most AI bots suggested, I don't have two factor authentication but still tried it, nothing.
6. made sure I was signed in to github on my browser before trying any of these by the way,
7. reinstall vs code because why not, god damnit.
8. check developer tools console for any warnings or errors for the network, you guessed it.

if you see this and don't know what to do please upvote maybe someone who has a similar problem sees it and hopefully has a solution, if you do I will include you in my prayers.

I would give my hand and or leg for any clue about this as it no longer is about saving my code from withering away due to power outages but is now about my dignity and self respect as a junior developer.

1isa99s,Locked out of an account with ongoing subscription,"First of all and in my defense I was very young when I set up my github account first year of school about a decade ago, barely ever touched it after that, quickly set up sub for Copilot at some point and never bothered to check my old student email for warnings about 2FA.

Now I don't know if I didn't set up 2FA properly or if someone got access to my account and set it up for themseleves (account looks fine, old public repositories ok, no visible activity on my profile) but it sure is enabled and I have essentially no way to log in ever again. 

Whatever, such is the game of 2FA, fine. It's an old student account with almost nothing on it anyway.

1. Will the agents feature cost extra to regular copilot? Will there be faster and slower requests depending on your subscription? A ballpark figure would be fine
1. Will the agents feature allow selecting different AI models to send questions to?
1. When do you guess this is going to move to stable? Ballpark figure is fine as well, I understand there can be a long road ahead.
1. Why is it called Copilot when under the hood it uses the Claude model? I thought all Copilot branding from Microsoft uses the ChatGPT and other OpenAI models?
1. Are there third party AI assistants you look at for inspiration and what features you saw them implement that you just had to have?
1. Will there be a solution to automatically import dependencies with autocomplete or do you really rely on agents to do that?
1. Will Copilot in the future implement eslint/stylelint/htmlhint and other linters to write the code how you want it?
1. Will copilot be open to third party extensions to implement as AI backend or have them use AI for certain features too or will it be limited to what VSCode and Copilot decide?

mes4fe3,,"Thanks for interesting questions. Let me answer, but keep in mind that this is my personal point of view as a VS Code product manager.  
1. Right now I am not aware of any no plans to change the cost structure. So agent mode will be available to Free/Pro/Business/Enterprise.

2. It already allows (claude 3.5, 3.7, gpt-4o) - give it a try!

3. I already answered that in this discussion. Rough estimate mid-March

4. This is a more of a marketing / branding question. But just because it is called Copilot does not mean it must only talk to OpenAI models. I do not think we as MS ever made that statement for any of the Copilot products.

5. We already get a large amount of user feedback / feature requests. So as always just listening to our users gives us enough signals to decide what to do next

6. Regular suggestions (non AI ones) can auto import on accept sometimes. It makes sense that GH Copilot supports this. Please file a feature request [https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release) and ping me at isidorn

7. Agent mode already listens on lint / error changes via the getErrors tool and auto-corrects

8. We already have a Chat and Language Model extensibility story [https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release) and [https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model) and we continuously try to expand our API surfaces. So tell us what you would like to see, and share your scenarios!

9. Per each API we decide if we want to finalise it and expose it to all extensions or not. So far we have finalised: completions, chat, language model, shell integration (that Cline extension send kudos to us for doing). Having said that there are still APIs that are proposed and not possible to be used by all 3rd party extensions.

thanks for every one that contributed to ending this nightmare.



I have been trying to sign in to GitHub from vscode for about two weeks now and to no avail

I believe I have tried everything, searched the web for similar issues but for the first time no one had a similar issue, I have tried every AI chat there is, Gpt, deep seek, even copilot on github's website but nothing.

the issue looks very simple which is why it has dumbfounded me so much.

here's how it goes: vscode says I have to sign in to github to use associated features like copilot or to save my code in a repository, but when I do a pop up appears on the bottom right that says signing in to github.

I have stared at this pop up for longer than I can admit.

eventually after a couple minutes it says I haven't finished configuring the authenticator extension or something and says it will try to sign in using a local host, another half an hour and after it fails, gives me a code to past on the website to sign in, I do that and it says your all set, returning to vs code reveals that I am indeed not all set. as it gives me an ""Error signing in to github"" ""try again"" in a smug way

at first I thought nothing of it and it wasn't a big deal until a couple of days ago when I lost a big chunk of a project I've been working on for my collage

I'm so frustrated with every thing about this as no one seems to relate and I feel like the only one with this issue

I saw a post on stackoverflow for someone with what he described to be a similar issue to mine but no one seemed to know why and no solution to the problem was posted

here's a bunch of things I tried to do but didn't work

1. I'm working from home so no firewall or vpn or anything similar to try and block the extension I think.
2. tried to manually sign in using github from the terminal by configuring my user name and email. still nothing.
3. cleared any previous credentials stored on the extension if there was any since it didn't work once. nope. not it.
4. uninstall and reinstall, multiple times, nah.
5. use the token, most AI bots suggested, I don't have two factor authentication but still tried it, nothing.
6. made sure I was signed in to github on my browser before trying any of these by the way,
7. reinstall vs code because why not, god damnit.
8. check developer tools console for any warnings or errors for the network, you guessed it.

I would give my hand and or leg for any clue about this as it no longer is about saving my code from withering away due to power outages but is now about my dignity and self respect as a junior developer.

🌟 **Hello Vim Enthusiasts!** 🌟

As a fellow Vim lover, I’ve built **vscode-vim-mode** to gently bridge Vim’s efficiency with VS Code’s modern features. If you’re curious about blending these worlds, I’d be honored if you gave it a try.

👉 **What it offers**:

* **Lightweight Vim/Neovim integration** without disrupting your VS Code workflow (Copilot, extensions, etc).
* **Peaceful coexistence**: Runs alongside plugins like VSCodeVim or VSCodeNeovim.
* **Simple toggle**: Switch modes with a button or command—no complexity.
* **Optional save sync**: For Neovim users, quietly trigger formatting on save.

This is a small attempt to serve the Vim community. If it makes even one coder’s day smoother, I’ll consider it worthwhile.

📦 **If you’d like to explore**:

* [Install via VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wy-z.vscode-vim-mode)
* [View or contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/wy-z/vscode-vim-mode)

**Thank you** for your time—and if you run into any issues or have suggestions, please feel free to reach out. Your feedback would mean a lot!

*Happy coding, and may your keystrokes stay efficient!* 🚀

As a fellow Vim lover, Ive built vscodevimmode to gently bridge Vims efficiency with VS Codes modern features. If youre curious about blending these worlds, Id be honored if you gave it a try. What it offers Lightweight VimNeovim integration without disrupting your VS Code workflow Copilot, extensions, etc. Peaceful coexistence Runs alongside plugins like VSCodeVim or VSCodeNeovim. Simple toggle Switch modes with a button or commandno complexity. Optional save sync For Neovim users, quietly trigger formatting on save. This is a small attempt to serve the Vim community. If it makes even one coders day smoother, Ill consider it worthwhile. If youd like to explore Install via VS Code Marketplace View or contribute on GitHub Thank you for your timeand if you run into any issues or have suggestions, please feel free to reach out. Your feedback would mean a lot! Happy coding, and may your keystrokes stay efficient!

mcs0hbw,,"Yes, from the autocomplete, or I'd have turned it off entirely. I *do* turn it off entirely for personal projects, and I'm not even a little bit interested in the chat or ""agent"" part, but the autocomplete is *sometimes* useful:

First, it can help when traditional Intellisense stuff is broken. We have a large Python codebase, and standard VSCode Python tools want to crawl the entire workspace and load all of the types into memory for some reason. Sometimes it'll crawl enough of it to start doing useful things for me (while using multiple cores and basically all RAM it can get its hands on). But when that's not working, very small *code* completions from Copilot can be helpful.

Second, it seems to be good enough at boilerplate to be more useful than just copy/paste. IMO this is not a massive deal, because if you have so much boilerplate that you need an LLM to deal with it, you should instead get rid of that boilerplate. But an exception is test code, which is intentionally more repetitive and explicit. And I have occasionally had the experience of typing literally just the name of the test I want, like

    def test_do_thing_X_with_Y_disabled():

or whatever detailed name... and it fills in the entire body of the test, adapted for my actual test method, and gets it right the first time. I suspect this is where we get the ""replace a junior"" ideas -- it doesn't replace the *best* things juniors can do, but it can do some of the shit work you'd otherwise ask a junior to do.

I've occasionally had it generate longer chunks that were kind of okay starting points, but where I ended up replacing maybe 80% of what it generated. Pretty sure this is where MS gets their bullshit ""50% improvement"" numbers from, if they're counting the amount of generated suggestions that people hit tab to accept, and not the number that actually get *used.* And also, the longer the generated snippet, the more likely it is to get it wrong, so there's no way I'm excited about the whole ""agent mode"" idea of prompting it to make sweeping refactors to multiple files. The idea of assigning a Jira task to it and expecting it to complete it on its own seems like an absolute pipe dream.

mffmagh,,"I've met a lot of those teachers - they seem to think that programming (any kind of programming, be it HTML, XML, CSS, JSON, or Java, C, Python, JavaScript) is about learning keywords and syntax, and automagically being able to organize and structure code while learning the semantics and logic at the same time.

I used to have the same idea, until I noticed that what students learning with notepad was struggling with, was syntax, forgetting semicolons or brackets, or closing tags, where as what students learning with actual modern editors was struggling with, was understanding how to most effectively solve the problems given in the assignments.

What finally convinced me of the stupidity of the ""better learn it the simple way first"" was when I had a class that was taught with all the fancy plugins, getting rainbow-colored bracket-matching, automatic indentation, automatic tag-closing, automatic formatting and automatic highlighting of compile and validation errors, as well as syntax highlighting. After their first semester another class started with one of the notepad-teachers, and some of the students that had been learning with all the modern tools were employed as teaching assistants. They could easily spot errors in syntax (indentation, missing closing etc.) in the notepad-students' work, and help them fix it - even though they didn't have all the fancy tools at their disposal. And they soon realized that these poor students weren't learning programming, but were learning how to structure and format code correctly - and the new students never reached the same level as the ones with the fancy tools.

The only tool I'm still not too thrilled about is the fully automatic line-completion in JetBrains editors - as well as of course using CoPilot or other tools to actually write the code. But anything that can help you structure the code and avoid writing syntax errors - I'd recommend it.

1j7c5qa,Software engineer who is bad at planning,"I’m a software engineer who is bad at planning. 

Ways in which this affects me:
- Writing design docs bores me. I would rather prototype and learn as I do. Though I do see benefit of designing to ensure requirements are clear, evaluate trade-offs, and prevent wasted efforts / inefficient solutions. I see the benefit. I just don’t enjoy writing them as much. I like to do. 
- It’s difficult for me to estimate the ETA of a task. I’d rather just work on two important tasks in parallel and try to finish both as quickly as possible. When I am blocked on one, I work on the other. 
- And I’m worried that Cursor/Copilot AI is going to automate me, and I don’t really have any career plan here when that happens. 


Can anyone relate? Does anyone have any advice?

Currently I just try to work with good planners and shower them with a lot of appreciation (though let’s be real, good planners are already highly rewarded in every workplace and industry).

1j5bf4o,Looking for resources to practice practical coding interview style questions,"I've been laid off for awhile now and been in the industry for 5 years. Been doing leetcode and studying system design, polishing my resume/CLs and all other behavioural questions I can think of.

So far I always ace the initial leetcode interviews, system design questions and behavioural questions, but the moment I hit practical questions, my brain shuts off and and works at a snails pace. I've gotten really good at communicating my thoughts with the design for how to solve the problem, but coding the solution is very slow for me, where I backtrack to use better data structures. It doesn't come easy, and I only seem to know what to do as I code, and by the time I have a better idea of how to code it's too late, it's the end of the interview, and the interviewer is looking at me like I'm a fraud.

Just looking to see where I can find more practical interview questions for me to practice. Copilot is unable to generate these for me, it just generates the same ones or points me towards leetcode questions.

Please drop down any resources below, I'd really appreciate it. Been out of a job for more than half a year now and my wallet is not too happy :'(

Here's an example of one of these practical interview questions I got from a very recent interview, in case I'm using the wrong term:  
**Water Distribution Problem:** Given the water levels of a series of connected containers, calculate how to redistribute water to ensure no container's level goes below a threshold.

1inmmaq,"Best solution for checking Javascript typos quickly, NOT tied to Visual Studio?","Hello, all. Yes, I've been reading the FAQ and tools pages.

I use Javascript for RPG Maker scripts, so nothing overly complex or heavy. Normally, I use Notepad++ to actually write my code, as it's lightweight and fast, and has syntax coloring. However, if I ever have a typo, I can't exactly jump to it in N++. I have several plugins from the Plugins Admin window related to JS and JSON, but none of them seem to offer syntactical or typographic checkers.

To check typos, I was using VSCode, but MS is starting to push Copilot more and more as a base feature. I don't want to use Copilot and I don't want AI features I can't disable--- MS, after all, is well-known for forcing stupid shit on users after updates. I know that vscodium is an open-source fork of Visual Studio, but if Copilot is integrated more deeply into VS in the future, then vscodium could potentially be unable to remove it without fucking things up. Since vscodium is open-source, this is not as likely as a closed system, but I'd still rather become independent from the VS ecosystem now as opposed to later.

I would like to run through the options presented on the tools page and discuss how I have weighed each of them. I will ignore the IDE section as none of them are tailored to JS, so we can only discuss the editors.

VSCode: no

Sublime Text: Looked great! But it's paid, and I'm poor.

Atom: No longer available.

N++: If there is a plugin to identify and jump to typos in JS code, I'd love a recommendation.

TextMate: no Mac machine

Brackets: I've used this when I took web design courses at university, and rather enjoyed doing so. It seems to have been succeeded by Phoenix Code. PHCode has JSHint for browser-based checking, but I use Firefox, so I can't open local files on the web editor. Otherwise, you have to use ESLint, but I'm not even sure if I can make ESLint a dependency of my RPG Maker project, and even if I could, setting it up looks confusing. (I'm really bad at CLI stuff and it seems like every time I try it something breaks that shouldn't...)

gedit: Paid for MS.

Komodo Edit/IDE: I can't tell if the free tier supports JS or not.

1iy96r9,Struggling with Mid-Level Full-Stack Interviews – Need Advice on Prep,"Hey everyone,

I’m a mid-level full-stack engineer with **3 years of experience**, mainly working with **React, Node.js, and AWS**, and I’m currently looking for my next role in **London**. The interview process has been a bit of a rollercoaster—every company seems to have a completely different approach, and I’m struggling to figure out how to prepare efficiently.

So far, I’ve come across:

* **LeetCode-style DS&A questions** (fairly standard, but still hit-or-miss on difficulty)
* **Verbal technical deep dives** (these range from broad discussions to very specific knowledge checks)
* **Pair programming sessions** (this is where I feel the least prepared)

I find that because the formats vary so much, I don’t know where to focus my time. Has anyone else dealt with this? What’s the best way to prep, especially for **pair programming**? I also find it harder and more daunting because I feel like I’ve become reliant on Copilot, and writing code from my own head seems much harder now. Are you ever allowed to use tools like this in these kinds of interviews?

1it3dhk,[Partially Rant] I truly want to use AI but..,"Hello everyone. I'm actually using ChatGPT and Copilot to help me in my daily job. Since now I just used those to help me write basic functions as some sort of personal assistant. Stuff like ""provide a function that sorts my array of objects given that specific logic"" or ""provide a boilerplate for that framework using that other framework"". This because I never managed to get something more usefull from an LLM. 

Cause people keep saying I'm the one who uses them bad I've spent the last 4 months trying to leverage LLM power to a further level...failing miserably. 

As a test project I'm now trying to convert a 3d engine I've already wrote in C++ to a webgl2 engine using typescript. I decided to use ChatGPT o1 and o3 since the beginning of the project hoping that the LLM could keep its own context updated by not needing to interpret some already existing sources. ChatGPT was able to provide a typescript project with the Hello World of 3d programming:  a working WebGL2  example with a static triangle. Nice! 

  
At this point problems arise.  As the project grew and modularity kicked in ChatGPT started allucinating badly. As every decent 3d engine works I split my Classes into modules. So now I have a Renderer class, a Scene class, a Mesh class, some Utility classes like CompileShaders, LoadTextures and so on. 

  
No matter how hard I try and how frequently I reupload my sources, ChatGPT keeps ""forgetting"" stuff he has provided and keeps writing (buggy) new code as the previous work never existed. I need a new shader? ChatGPT keeps writing private functions to load and compile shaders, even if I just reminded it he already provided a Utility class that specifically does that.  A texture? Let's rewrite the texture loading code instead of using the already existing one that ChatGPT itself provided. 

And BLODY HELL, I hate when it does an error and I need to keep telling it to not include that error. ""Hey that part is wrong, you should do it that way"" ""Ok"" And then, after one step, it keeps doing the same error I told it not to do.

I tried updating the context by explaining stuff, by re-uploading to ChatGPT the current sources, using single files, using an archive of the whole folder. Nothing works. It seems it can ""remember"" stuff it did for 1 or 2 steps then it restarts from scratch.

Learning to Google is a skill, if you can't do it, it's quite obvious to someone that knows how to do it.

1j8d7rx,Upgrading Old PHP Website (PHP 5 → PHP 8.x) Using AI - Need Guidance,"Hey!

I’m currently upgrading an old PHP 5 website to the latest PHP version. I have all original files (public_html), including PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various include files. The website’s structure and appearance need to remain exactly the same—only backend code (mostly PHP) needs upgrading for compatibility and security.

I’ve used AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude extensively, but it’s becoming cumbersome due to context window limitations. Each new chat loses context about my project.

My Ideal Scenario:
	•	Upload the entire public_html folder somewhere (like GitHub).
	•	Have an AI (GitHub Copilot or something similar) analyze the entire folder, understand interdependencies among files, and help me update outdated PHP code seamlessly.
	•	Continuously test and ensure the website remains functional at every step.

I’ve heard good things about GitHub Copilot with Claude 3.7 Sonnet integration and Codespaces, but I’m not experienced enough to fully understand if this meets my needs. Can anyone experienced in upgrading legacy PHP sites using AI tools guide me?

Key Questions:
	•	Is GitHub Copilot Pro good enough to handle a full website upgrade from PHP 5 to latest versions?
	•	Can it maintain context across multiple files effectively?
	•	How do you practically test database connections and functionality within this AI-assisted workflow?
	•	Any pitfalls or better approaches?

1j6d84j,Best AI for Programming (2025-03),"Hey all, I've been using free-tier AI tools pretty intensively over the past few months to support my work and daily life. About 70% of my usage is for programming, and the rest is for other stuff. I’ve been jumping between tools like ChatGPT, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Deepseek—mostly because one of them is usually down or hits its limit when I need it.

Recently, I discovered Lovable dev (along with similar options like Bolt and v0) and gave it a try—pretty impressive stuff 😅. Now I'm feeling a bit stuck on which one is really worth upgrading to a paid subscription.

Any thoughts or suggestions? Also, if anyone’s got a setup that mixes two or more free AIs or even self-hosting options (whether on your own hardware or a rented server), I'm all ears.

I use several IDE's and one thing they all share is a thriving AI ecosystem. From JetBrains to VSCode the drive to AI is hard to ignore. That  VSCode-->Copilot-->GitHub workflow is really something and keeps getting better.

Codeium, Cursor and such only make it easier and as open source models emerge and costs come down it's only going to get more common.

Being able to say, ""Using DDEV, create a directory, make a database and clone this repo into it then run the install script "" and have it all work is freakin' magic.

I can feed this thing specific docs. I'm not a smart man, there are many docs that I find impenetrable and many more that I constantly Google. Relating those docs to the codebase that I'm working in purely amazing -- I can find out anything. Right where I actually need it.

what do you think about microsoft copilot

Microsoft Copilot is a powerful AI tool that has the potential to revolutionize how we work and interact with technology. It's still relatively new, but it's showing a lot of promise. Here's a breakdown of what I think about it:

**What I like:**

* **Integration with Microsoft 365:** Copilot's tight integration with Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook is a game-changer. It can help you write documents, create presentations, analyze data, and manage emails more efficiently.
* **Productivity boost:** Copilot can automate repetitive tasks, suggest relevant content, and provide quick answers to your questions, saving you time and effort.
* **Creative assistance:** It can help you brainstorm ideas, generate creative content, and overcome writer's block.
* **Accessibility:** Copilot can make technology more accessible to people with disabilities by providing alternative ways to interact with computers.

**What could be improved:**

* **Accuracy:** Like any AI model, Copilot can sometimes make mistakes or provide inaccurate information. It's important to double-check its output and use your own judgment.
* **Privacy concerns:** Using AI tools that have access to your data raises privacy concerns. Microsoft needs to be transparent about how it uses your data and ensure that it's protected.
* **Bias:** AI models can inherit biases from the data they're trained on. It's important to be aware of these biases and work towards making Copilot more inclusive and equitable.
* **Cost:** Copilot is a paid service, which may be a barrier for some users.

**Overall:**

Microsoft Copilot is a promising tool with the potential to significantly improve productivity and creativity. It's not perfect, but it's constantly evolving and improving. I believe that AI tools like Copilot will become increasingly important in the future of work, and I'm excited to see how they develop.

**Here are some resources you might find helpful:**

* \*\*Microsoft Copilot website:\*\*https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/
* \*\*Microsoft Copilot blog:\*\*https://www.copilot.microsoft.com/
* \*\*Microsoft Copilot documentation:\*\*https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/

I encourage you to try Copilot for yourself and see how it can help you in your work and personal life.

what do you think of google gemini?

Google Gemini is an advanced AI assistant developed by Google, designed to enhance creativity and productivity. It builds on the capabilities of Google Assistant, offering more natural language understanding and reasoning2. Gemini can help with a wide range of tasks, from writing and planning to learning and more. It also introduces new features like native tool use, image creation, and speech generation3.

Gemini aims to provide a more personalized and conversational experience, making it easier for users to interact with AI and get things done. It's a significant step forward in AI technology, offering enhanced performance and capabilities compared to previous models3.

What specific features of Google Gemini are you interested in?

what do you think of google gemini?

Google Gemini is poised to be a significant leap forward in the world of artificial intelligence. Developed by Google DeepMind, it's expected to be a multimodal AI system, meaning it can process and generate content across different types of data like text, images, and perhaps even audio and video. This integration could allow for more sophisticated understanding and interaction, blurring the lines between different forms of information.

What's exciting about Gemini is its potential to handle complex tasks that current models might struggle with. For instance, it could read a piece of text, analyze an accompanying image, and provide insights that consider both sources simultaneously. This could revolutionize fields like education, where interactive and adaptive learning experiences become more immersive, or in creative industries, where AI could assist in generating rich multimedia content.

However, it's also important to consider the ethical implications. As AI systems become more advanced, questions around data privacy, security, and the potential for misuse become even more critical. Ensuring that technologies like Gemini are developed and implemented responsibly will be key to harnessing their benefits without unintended consequences.

It's fascinating to think about how Gemini might influence everyday life. Imagine virtual assistants that not only understand your words but also interpret visual cues to provide more personalized assistance. Or consider advancements in healthcare diagnostics, where AI could analyze medical images and patient data to support doctors in making more accurate diagnoses.

Asking CoPilot with the think deeper option enabled what do you think of google gemini? Google Gemini is poised to be a significant leap forward in the world of artificial intelligence. Developed by Google DeepMind, its expected to be a multimodal AI system, meaning it can process and generate content across different types of data like text, images, and perhaps even audio and video. This integration could allow for more sophisticated understanding and interaction, blurring the lines between different forms of information. Whats exciting about Gemini is its potential to handle complex tasks that current models might struggle with. For instance, it could read a piece of text, analyze an accompanying image, and provide insights that consider both sources simultaneously. This could revolutionize fields like education, where interactive and adaptive learning experiences become more immersive, or in creative industries, where AI could assist in generating rich multimedia content. However, its also important to consider the ethical implications. As AI systems become more advanced, questions around data privacy, security, and the potential for misuse become even more critical. Ensuring that technologies like Gemini are developed and implemented responsibly will be key to harnessing their benefits without unintended consequences. Its fascinating to think about how Gemini might influence everyday life. Imagine virtual assistants that not only understand your words but also interpret visual cues to provide more personalized assistance. Or consider advancements in healthcare diagnostics, where AI could analyze medical images and patient data to support doctors in making more accurate diagnoses. Have you thought about how an AI like Gemini could impact areas youre interested in or passionate about? The possibilities are vast, and its an exciting time to consider the future of humanAI collaboration.","{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.233, 'compound': 0.9996}",0.9996,"{'polarity': 0.21247978928701816, 'subjectivity': 0.5985317894956448}",0.21247978928701816,0.5985317894956448,Positive,0.9996
