1j8qslh,Top 4 AI Coding Tools Offering Specialized Development Support,"For developers seeking tools that go beyond generic AI assistance, here are four platforms which I have tested that offer specialized coding support in no particular order: 

* [BlackBox AI](https://www.blackbox.ai/): Designed specifically for coding, it provides hands-on assistance with smart code completions, full-stack app generation, and automation across diverse projects. 
* [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/): A VS Code-based tool with AI-driven suggestions, ideal for real-time coding support and multi-file edits. 
* [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf): Focuses on intuitive UI and autonomous coding help, with strong context awareness for developers. 
* [Replit](https://replit.com/): Combines an IDE with AI agents, emphasizing execution and collaborative coding environments. 

Have you used or integrated any of these tools into your workflow?

mhe51be,,"# !!! SOLVED !!!

Caveat: likely not work for anyone else - Sorry

I had this happen to me today, the write\_file tool worked fine, but the edit\_file tool failed everytime.  
The error is consistent: ""incomplete envelope"" from [192.34.20.166:443](http://192.34.20.166:443)

If I made a new file, no issue, and I could then move it around, but this also BURNED down my flow credits.

They showed up as ReparsePoint in my filesystem:

Solution for me was to not have the files live in a dropbox folder, and move them to a ""simple"" folder.

I got it all moved over the a simple folder, and then it worked fine for me immediately.

Wanted to set up a automated self-hosted Gitlab in WSL, but then I ran out of flow credits and now I am seriously thinking I should just do it manually like a common coder :D

I was to be honest leaning on Windsurf to do things that I could just as easily do myself, so I guess it is fair I lost all of my credits.

Cascade Base simply refuses to do too many changes and you have to do 1 at a time.


If I ask for small, targeted changes with very precise instructions, Cascade Base works so well that I don't even use the other models.

Currently the new developers, completely resonated upon ai doing their work don't even know where to place their code properly, because AI does it for them. Then what's the point of coding? 

""Vibe coding"" is not even coding anymore as promoted. Coding involves problem solving and technical thinking, while ai is very good at it, especially claude, but still, you need understanding of what caused the issue.

1j5oiw9,I think I have a love-hate relationship with Windsurf.,"We are all using the same software, but we all encounter different bugs.
So here is my experience based on what I read and what I encounter, using Windsurf:

Someone says that Cascade Base prevents file modification: absolutely not, I use it constantly.

Someone says it fails to log in: absolutely not, I use it constantly.

Someone says it encounters a lot of calling tools errors, continuously, in loop: yes, it can happen, with some specific models, and that's why I don't use them.

A tip to avoid this cascade of errors: use Chat mode and take the trouble of copy/pasting manually.

Deepseek V3 is much less buggy, when used in Chat mode, and for some specific tasks it is more powerful than Cascade Base (sometimes Cascade Base is more powerful...depending on what you are doing).

The main problem concerns the interaction between LLM and calling tools, avoiding Write mode solves most of these problems.

It is true that we are also paying to use Write mode, the real convenience is that... but we can't expect everything right away, let's give the guys at Codeium time to understand how to really solve all the problems.

The more we put pressure on them to solve, the less they will be able to do it.
If we expect a solution by today, they will risk fixing one thing and breaking 10 others, let's leave the guys to work in peace.

For now, let's find alternative solutions and be patient.

Yesterday I created a rather nervous post, then deleted it, I thought I had found a bug that wasn't there (sorry), my PC had just gone crazy momentarily.
A restart of Windsurf solved it, even if in reality there was a small problem and it remained, but it's so silly that we can ignore it...

Some say that Turbo mode for terminal doesn't work and Cascade can't execute commands.
The opposite happens to me, even if I set it Off, Cascade very often offers me to launch commands without any prompt.
If you have the same problem, I solved it this way:
Add a global rule: ""User imposes a total ban on you from using the terminal""
It stopped offering me terminal suggestions!

Reasons why I don't want Cascade to use the terminal: sometimes when it completes a command, it doesn't close the terminal and when I try to execute a command later, it fails saying that there is another terminal open for the same purpose.
So I prefer to manage it manually, keeping control.

Ideas to not burn credits when using aggressive models like 3.7:
avoid using it for web searches.
use Cascade Base or Deepseek V3.
If they find less information than 3.7, you can force them to search again and again and again...
Because they are free.
Once you have done your research, use 3.7 only for writing.

Or: you can generate code with Cascade Base / Deepseek V3 and then ask 3.7 to refactor the code with inline command, all for free.

One thing some people don't understand about Cascade is that it manages context and memories for all available LLMs.
So I see some people wasting credits because they think that switching from one model to another will erase the memory...
It doesn't. Don't worry.
In a conversation you can switch from Cascade Base to 3.7 to 3.5 to GPT4o to Deepseek R1 and then switch back to Cascade Base, it will be like always talking to the same LLM, meaning everyone will have access to the same information.

If you need to start a new conversation, then you need to set rules and constantly update them, or create and update memories, to make sure that the context is maintained when switching conversations.

I've noticed that a correct markdown formatting is more understandable for Cascade memories.

So don't limit yourself to bulleted or numbered lists or simple human writing.
Write your list and then ask Cascade Base to format it properly in markdown, then have it read the file you wrote and tell it to create a memory with that information.

When you ask about its memories, it will not just spit out the data it reads, but it will actually seem ""aware"" of the information, it seems like it really understands the concepts this way.

Conclusion: Windsurf's behavior seems inconsistent, this makes it harder to understand when a problem is strictly related to an LLM, when it is strictly related to Windsurf, when it is strictly related to the Cascade / LLM integration .. and when the problem is us .. it just seems like a big mess.

But trying to keep this mess at bay, my experience is quite positive.

There are problems for sure and sometimes I hate it and feel frustrated because it feels like I'm throwing my money away, but I also think it's an investment for the future... I mean, if in 2 years Windsurf will be great and everyone will love it, it will also be thanks to my subscription money, certainly not thanks to those who say ""I'm switching to Cursor"" or other things.
It's obvious that everyone is free to proceed as they want, but hoping for the improvement of a software while you take away its funding is inconsistent and counterproductive.


I must say, among other things, that since I wrote this post (based mainly on my previous two months of experience), I have noticed several improvements. Now I'm using Write mode without too many problems, for example. I also used Claude 3.7 in Write mode and I didn't encounter any cascade of errors, for example.
So the guys are really working to improve the software, but we have to be a little patient...

2. Lose.

mgx81ap,,"Again, your point makes perfect sense. They probably have the wrong approach, but they are probably just using marketing techniques, like everyone else in the world: is there an advertisement that warns you of potential problems with a product? No. Products are always all wonderful, all fantastic, all miraculous... in advertisements... then you buy them and find something different. This happens in any field. The difference is that if I am buying a piece of furniture it will not receive updates, so the furniture must be a valid product at the time I buy it. A software can be updated, and all software is modified over time, through user feedback (who often have different desires and therefore it is difficult to please everyone, someone will inevitably remain dissatisfied). Now what happens if users keep switching from one platform to another? Today I finance X, tomorrow I finance Y, the day after tomorrow I finance Z...
I fuel competition between software, preventing the consistent growth of a single software.
There will be a month when Windsurf will have more funds to move forward, there will be periods when Cursor will have more funds, there will be periods when other platforms will have more funds.
So this situation is created where performances go up and down and no one ever comes out a winner, it's a constant challenge for everyone.
People should make up their minds, if they want to grow Cursor, they have to pay Cursor, if they want to grow Windsurf, they have to pay Windsurf, if they want to grow something else, they have to pay something else. If they just want to complain, maybe they should stick to using free services, so they don't feel robbed by anyone. Constructive criticism is sacrosanct and I certainly don't censor myself, if I have to say something I don't like about the Codeium team, I will. But I see people who really just complain and all they do is say that they close their subscription with Windsurf and open a subscription elsewhere.
Here's the gist: if you want to see Windsurf grow and you stop giving them money, to give it to another service, then you will help another service grow, instead of Windsurf, so then don't complain if Windsurf fails to grow.

1j8t0y2,Extreme frustration with windsurf flow,"I am a senior dev.

Today was my 2nd try to use the flow feature where you allow windsurf to write code and change directory etc. It was a brutally frustrating experiance. Worked great till the first 5 simple commands. Moment i started making specific styling requirements it made overhauling changes to global css, ruining the whole app. 

When i tried to make it rollback, it hallucinated for hours and kept runing it further. Finally, had to abandon the project. 

I use claude 3.7 sonnet. It was a day fully wasted. So i will go back to using the windsurf chat and not playing with write again for the time being. I guess, problems like these give ai a backseat when it comes to serious developments on critical projects.

1j9pd4b,Windsurf burns through credits by continuously correcting itself,"In this state this hardly more than a fun gimmick. I've tried four different project types now (composing a bash script, setting op a small Spring Boot project, setting up a React/Zustand based web UI and some CUDA code) and in all cases it just loses track once you get beyond even the smallest of setups. As I type this it's in a 20 step flow of fixing a bash script, run it, see a problem, claim it fixed it, run it, same problem, tries variant it already tried. Whatever the combination of memory, attention and model is causing this behavior is unclear to me. I've upgraded a few hours ago and I've burnt through 15% of my total monthly budget. And that's ignoring the fact that it bails on generating edits about 30% of the time with an error (I suspect due to the large size of the scripts it created and them being too large an amount of input tokens for an edit or just service outages, hard to say). Is anyone actually using this for production level codebases? Also, any model other than Claud is doing this thing where it suggests a fix without actually editing the files until you tell it something like ""do it"". 

P.S. It would be an interesting optimization to have some sort of (non LLM/ML based) short term history of generated content so it can avoid burning credits on generating the same command line invocations over and over again. As per the above mine is continuously doing a fix and then ""Let me run our updated script that now properly handles project IDs and follows our standardized service account structure:"" which has been the same bash command for about an hour now.",2025-03-12 10:20:13,21,8,1.0,Codeium,SignificantPhrase635,True,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j9pd4b/windsurf_burns_through_credits_by_continuously/

from chatgpt  
Enabling “Detect Proxy” effectively forces Windsurf to reload its network settings and environment. If you were behind a firewall or proxy—or if Windsurf’s network detection had gotten stuck—toggling that setting can refresh its connection logic. In other words, when you switch on “Detect Proxy,” Windsurf does a fresh check for how it should connect to servers. This can sometimes fix issues where the software was not properly detecting your network configuration or was stuck in a “loading” loop.

1j89927,Is it possible to use Windsurf Previews with Cypress e2e framework?,"If you're familiar with Cypress, when configured to open Chrome, it opens it's own browser instance which proxies everything through `/__/#/` path (smth. like `http://localhost:4000/__/#/specs`)  to it's own internal server. And this instance runs the e2e tests. [Link](https://docs.cypress.io/app/guides/cross-origin-testing#What-Cypress-does-under-the-hood)

Unfortunately, it's not possible to open this url through external browser, therefore it's not possible to provide the Cascade with better context.

There's also no MCP for Cypress in sight, unfortunately.

I know that the best solution would be to move to Playwright, but the project I work at has thousands of Cypress tests already.

I’m a Korean developer, and I often need to use Korean text in README files, comments, or certain constant values.

Lately, I’ve been trying to tweak Windsurf’s memories to stop autocomplete from suggesting Korean text, but no matter how many rules I set, it still keeps popping up. It seems like those rules don’t actually affect autocomplete behavior.

Does anyone know if there’s a way to filter out specific words from autocomplete or control what gets suggested?

I'm having issues with **Windsurf** on **Ubuntu** and need help troubleshooting. Here’s what’s happening:

## **The Issues:**
1. **App Links & Redirects Not Working:**
   - When logging in via **Brave**, the browser doesn’t redirect to the Windsurf app.
   - Manual login also **fails** on Windsurf.

2. **Windsurf Diagnostics & Debugging:**
   - Checking `/tmp/windsurf-diagnostics.txt`, I see **""no space left on device""**, but `df -h` shows **plenty of space available**.
   - I also see errors like:
     ```
     [ERROR]: Failed to start language server: Error: Language server exited before sending start data
     ```

3. **Tried Reinstalling Windsurf:**
   - Followed the official installation guide:
     ```sh
     curl -fsSL ""https://windsurf-stable.codeiumdata.com/wVxQEIWkwPUEAGf3/windsurf.gpg"" | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/windsurf-stable-archive-keyring.gpg

     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get upgrade windsurf
     ```
   - The issue **remains the same** after reinstalling.

## **What I Need Help With:**
- Has anyone encountered **Brave login issues** with Windsurf on Ubuntu?
- How can I manually **force a login**?
- Any suggestions for **debugging the ""no space left on device"" error** when space is clearly available?
- How can I properly report this issue to the **Windsurf dev team**?

I’d really appreciate any help or guidance. Thanks in advance!

1j65ivj,Please rethink this,"I'll make this clear. I'm a heavy user of Windsurf consistently every day, every week, every month since the free trial in November. Not many users have more hours into Windsurf than I do. I am averaging 8-12 hours a day, every day, no BS. I support Codeium. I've recommended it to friends who actively use and pay for it. So this is coming from a place of support, but also as a paying customer, I definitely want to voice my opinion on sizeable issues. I dont want to go to another competitor. I'd like to stay with Windsurf, and I plan on doing so.

But. 

The flow actions - credits structure does not work. I went from $60 lasting weeks, sometimes almost a month, to lasting 2 days. Even when they discounted how many credits a flow uses, it's still borderline broken. Codeium gets charged per 1,000 tokens, and we're being charged every time even 1 file is analyzed. Whether it reads 50 lines and uses 40 tokens or 1,000 tokens, we're being charged a credit. In other words, whether it costs Codeium .0003 cents or .01 cent per analyzation or edit, we're being charged $.02 cents based on 3,000 flows @ $60.  

Its even worse if you need to buy additional, as 400 credits @ $10 costs us $.025 per flow, whether that specific flow costed Codeium $.0003 cents or not. But Codeium is still being charged the same per token from Anthropic. Even if 3.7 API is slightly more expensive than 3.5, the same exponential problem exists.

With the latest updates, Windsurf is analyzing 5x more files than it used to. Instead of making an edit to a file, costing US ONE credit. It will make 4 separate edits to the same file. Re-analyze the file again, and make 3x more edits. I went from averaging 5-7 flows per prompt to 18-25. Which means, we're being charged 4x per prompt.

I get it. Anthropic has adjusted to how Claude analyzes and edits files. Favoring more analyzations and smaller edits. The problem, IN MY OPINION, is Codeium is trying to brute force Claude to not do, what it's been redesigned to do. Theyre trying to add additional instructions to a new model to make it not do, what it was literally just redesigned to do. In doing so, theyre adding more context being sent to the AI which further degrades its ability, whilst simultaneously  attempting to make Claude work differently than it is designed - ALL for the sake of bending Claude to its credit-based pricing structure so their customers aren't being beat over the head with cost.

This is not the way. 

To put it simply:

The problem is not over analyzing or making smaller edits. The problem is how Codeium is charging its users. Instead of changing the way it charges away from token based, it's now trying to bend 3.7 to not do, what it needs to do, to be good, so that it's users aren't charged so much based on a token structure that does not work with AI token usage. In the process of trying to bend 3.7 to work cheaper, it's degrading 3.7's coding ability. So we are being overcharged for a worse version of 3.7... and, it's still over analyzing and over editing.

Let Anthropic & Claude work the way it was designed to, and just charge us based on token usage that Codeium is being charged for. By all means, make a profit. Add your reasonable upcharge into the token cost for users. But don't try to change the way Anthropic designed Claude to work.

I know that's what theyre doing because one of their employees was in here last week talking about how theyre trying to make it not do so many edits. That's not the problem. Do not do that. The problem is Codeiums flow cost model. 

Right now, if you were to purchase an additional 400 credits @ $10 that is $.025 per flow. Right now I am averaging 10-15 credits PER PROMPT. Let's call it 10. Thats $0.25 cents PER prompt. 

That's 40 prompts per $10. Thats expensive IF it worked perfectly every time. But it doesnt. Which actually doubles this entire problem. And part of the reason it doesnt work as well, is because of all the additional prompting rules they're adding to change 3.7. With that said, I know for a fact that those 40 prompts did not actually cost anywhere in the vicinity of $10 worth of tokens from Anthropic. My last prompt used 25 credits. That's 63 cents for one single prompt for Codeium, no possible way that costed anywhere near 63 cents from Anthropic.

Charge based on tokens. Let Claude do what it was designed to do. This should also make it easier for future based improvements or new models for Codeium. You dont have to constantly worry about a new AI using too many requests and charging your customers too much.

You have a great product, and a growing user base. I would seriously implore you to rethink your pricing/credit model. Because as of this very moment, I would say the current issue is not sustainable. I'm not writing this to say Windsurf sucks. Quite the opposite. It's fantastic. This is just a critical issue that needs addressed.

mgmlddk,,"While I do agree that Windsurf’s flow credit model compounds the issues introduced by 3.7 - 3.7 does eat a significantly greater amount of tokens for the same work that was performed in 3.5. The per token cost is identical between the models. 3.7 does produce much greater code quality; however, it will very rapidly burn through a significantly greater amount of tokens. I also spend a lot of money with Cline and Roo Code. Typically around 100 monthly. I have custom global & workspace rules to try and keep things economical. It didn’t help that Roo wasn’t properly reporting expenses from the new model. It did get through 2 days worth of what I had projected I would have accomplished with 3.5 in that first day. I had projected that 3.5 would have spent a total of about $10-$20 for each day, between sessions. When I added up the roughly $50 that Roo reported was spent between sessions, I thought it was a bit steep. Then I went to check the balance on Open Router, and found out it had went through a little over $150 worth of tokens.

The irony is that Codeium is charging 1 credit for using non-thinking 3.7, but only charges 1.25 credits for thinking, which easily uses 2-3x the amount of tokens. Like Cursor, there isn’t a good reason not to regularly use the thinking model to keep you on track and use fewer credits overall. The thinking model is better at paying attention to rules and staying on task. For powering a complex agent, it makes the most sense to encourage users to utilize a thinking model to work in tandem with the agent. Simple agents are a different story. I think if Codeium simply borrowed Cursor’s billing model - it would kind of fix itself.

Also, Cascade can read files that are open in the window, no matter the length, for 1 flow credit. You may want to ask it for what files it sees open in its metadata, because if it’s not in the metadata, Cascade can’t “see” it. Put in your rules to check if the file is in the open window, before using the API. Also, the the filesystem and memory MCP Servers can help save a lot of credits. The read_file tool in the filesystem MCP Server will expend one tool call to read an entire file. Write global and workspace rules to utilize MCP Servers when they will save you total credits spent.",2025-03-07 19:22:57,4,0,0.0,Codeium,captainspazlet,False,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j65ivj/please_rethink_this/mgmlddk/

1j5zdpw,Compliment when compliment is due ❤,"There's a lot of critic towards Windsurf, I myself wrote a post complaining about a barrage of errors and instability and constant hallucinations from cascade.  
  
But I really think it'd be unfair to not write a post complimenting all the improvements the team has delivered recently!  
  
Before claude 3.7 I had to choose between 3.5 which was stupid and didn't give any good solutions, or try my luck with R1 or O3 and going mad because it'd propose good solutions but refused to apply the changes even if I was on write mode and explicitly told it to write the changes to the file like ""PLEASE APPLY THE CHANGES YOU PROPOSED"".  
And not to mention the constant errors and instabilities. It really wasn't good and I almost gave up on Windsurf.

With Wave 3 and 4 and Claude 3.7 things changed DRASTICALLY, I can honestly say that I'm pretty happy using Windsurf. 3.7 almost always proposed good/sane solutions and cascade almost always applies everything flawlessly. The pre-configured MCP servers have been super useful, and I just solved a problem using the Preview feature: I selected an element that was looking wrong and another that was looking correctly, asked cascade ""why?"" and it figured out the problem and fixed it.

So just want to say THANKS! To the Windsurf team! You've been doing an amazing job!

PS: Token consumption has been great! I'm 1/3 through my subscription period (\~10 days), and I have \~60% of my tokens available, so it more or less lasts me a month. Im a senior developer so I don't use AI for everything, I only use 3.7 Thinking model that consumes 1.25 tokens, so for actual developers the amount of tokens right now is perfect!

The only feedback I have is that I still get a lot of ""Cascade error"", sometimes like 5 - 10 in a row. Not a deal breaker as everything else is working great! But if the team code fix these cascade errors I think its the missing thing to make Windsurf perfect IMO!",2025-03-07 12:26:22,25,6,0.97,Codeium,No-Significance-279,True,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j5zdpw/compliment_when_compliment_is_due/

I really think that if you’re a professional dev, the $15 plan is more than enough. I use 3.7 thinking for everything and it’s lasting me a month, but if you use LLM a lot you can use strategies like using the base model (which is unlimited and doesn’t consume tokens) for more mundane tasks and 3.7 for complex ones.

PERSONAL opinion: I think at this point Windsurf is better than Cursor. The only people for which cursor might be better are people that don’t know how to code and use LLM for everything, the unlimited slow premium model they have on Cursor becomes interesting on this situation.

1j8pivq,Sonnet 3.7 really impressed me for starting a project from scratch,"I shared my experience how I got frustrated from using sonnet 3.7 in my existing project. It costs lots of flow credits but didn't deliver ideal result. But given it is so relentlessly reviewed multiple files back and forth, I got the hope that it can do better at a blank project. So after developing the backend, I gave it a try with my flutter project. 

I tried to make the requirement as details as possible (though not as that detailed as when I was in the corp needing to pass the PRD to engineering team), and then I asked R1 to review the requirements and make a plan based on the requirement. Then I revised the plan a few times trying to reduce ambiguity.  I wasn't that greedy to make everything in the plan because I don't want to overload Sonnet and its buddies so I just got the onboarding module + shared components + core services + data models detailed in the requirement and plan. 

Then Sonnet 3.7 starts its working. It lasted about 30 mins, and more than 50 files were created. I saw it creating the files and then went through files to fix lint errors all over again, speaking of which I really appreciate Windsurf doesn't cost credits when fixing lint errors.

I started the simulator nervously but it successfully started and gave a workable app as I expected. There are still some small issues that I may need to fix later, but so far I was just amazed by what Sonnet 3.7 and Windsurf could do!

1j4lztg,"A few ideas for additional ""modes"" that I think could be amazing","I have a few ideas for mode prompts that I think could be really useful and I figured that rather than keeping them locked up in my head or launching a crazy ""Windsurf killer"" (I kid), I'd share them here lest they stimulate any interest.

The ""classic"" modes that everyone seems to be replicating at the moment are (IMO): code, chat (although nobody seems quite sure what the point is) and ""architect"" (or plan).

I suggest that there's huge latent potential in all of the following use-cases for agentic IDEs:

**Documentation Mode**

My idea for a documentation mode is one in which the agent/Cascade is primed to focus primarily not on code generation but on documenting the code base. Think about smaller repositories where the docs don't live in a separate repo yet. Or even something I've begun doing, which is creating my own reference doc folder in the repository where I get the agent to explain what it's done so that I can try to keep up with its changes. 

**UI/UX Mode**

My idea for this one is a mode where the agent is instructed to focus primarily on UI, UX, CSS. My thinking for this idea is that it would be great to offload some of the effort in prompting very specifically for work on certain parts of the repository. If the agent could know that this is a design session, it could be more targeted. 

**Backend/Frontend Etc**

Another idea for a mode to intentionally ring-fence the agent just a little. So you're working on an integrated codebase with frontend and backend together and you don't want the agent to start mopping up contacts from the wrong parts of the repo too easily and eagerly ... set a mode to guide its focus on one aspect.

**Debugging Mode**

Focused on proactively finding and remediating bugs.

**Security Mode**

Focused on proactively evaluating the security of the codebase, evaluating adherence to best practices based on the language, etc. An audit style functionality basically.

**Dev Ops Mode**

Focused on preparing deployment scripts and strategising deployment.

**Collaborative Mode**

Focused on helping users learn how to collaborate on coding projects, esp open source projects. Guides user towards the contribution guidelines in the repository. Guides on best practices in preparing clean branches and generating properly formatted pull requests.

**YOLO Mode**

Agent is preconfigured with a very high temperature and system-prompted to unleash their creativity on your codebase. Implement radical UI changes. Come up with and implement random feature additions. Don't ask the user. Could be perilous .. or fun.

**Education / Teaching Mode**

A mode where the primary objective of the agent isn't code generation and editing, but rather explaining code to you. This could be really interesting if you were able to provide an open-ended prompt asking something like, explain the overall structure of this. Or be a little bit more directive and point it to a specific part of the code base. I love learning programming by doing, so being able to have the agent pull in real examples could be a very powerful way of teaching,  IMO",2025-03-05 19:12:50,7,2,1.0,Codeium,danielrosehill,True,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j4lztg/a_few_ideas_for_additional_modes_that_i_think/
1j5nsmd,struggle and highlights with the last Update !,"I don’t have much coding experience beyond HTML/CSS, but I do have a good understanding of how things work conceptually. Over the past few days, I managed to put together some key components of an app idea I’ve been working on. Sonnet 3.7 is incredible—when it works.

https://reddit.com/link/1j5nsmd/video/nxoxhmjns9ne1/player

Yesterday, *after* the update, my experience was amazing (though the hours leading up to it were frustrating—spent a lot of credits with little to show for it. A partial refund would be nice since I burned through 2.8k credits in just five days).

Post-update, in just two prompts, I was able to create a plugin upload system with support for ZIP files, custom schema, deletion, and versioning. A few extra prompts helped iron out minor issues and styling. It all came together seamlessly! I ended up generating around eight different files to handle plugin registration, unzipping, and management.  See Video Below.

But today, it's back to being a nightmare—just look at the Layout Editor. I can't save the layout and item positions for each individual viewport size, and I’m also unable to add the ability to delete individual elements! - a pretty simple task, considering what Windsurf was able to do yesterday.

This kind of inconsistency from one day to the next is a serious problem. If AI tools like Claude Sonnet, Codeium, and others don’t address this, AI-assisted coding will remain a frustrating gamble rather than a reliable tool. 😕

mgkw7m2,,"I understand your frustration when it seems like performance declines one day to the next.

It sounds like you had an amazing experience after the update, creating a sophisticated plugin system with minimal prompts. Then, the challenges you're facing today with seemingly simpler tasks can be understandably frustrating. However one thing to keep in mind, is that as your application grows in complexity, making changes can naturally introduce new challenges.

Some factors that might help improve consistency:

* **Provide detailed context in your prompts** \- Being specific about what you're trying to accomplish and how it should integrate with your existing code
* **Break down tasks into smaller steps** \- This helps the AI focus on one aspect at a time
* **Include relevant code snippets** \- Showing the AI the specific parts of your project that need to be modified

The inconsistency you're experiencing isn't necessarily a sign that the AI is getting worse, but could reflect how the complexity of your project has evolved, requiring more precise communication with the AI.

Of course, users have tried breaking down their prompts into more detailed steps and have experimented with other AI models. However, as of today, there are cases where not a single prompt yields any result at all.

My intention with this post was never to ""bash"" Windsurf, but rather to highlight how great it *can* be. *However*, on days like today, yesterday, and all the other times users have reported issues, there needs to be a transparent statement—whether on Twitter, within the app, or elsewhere—informing the community that something is broken.

mgtz1q4,,"I can't help you much because you're working with things I don't know much about, but I understand how Windsurf works quite well, so I can help you on a couple of points: the .md documents are more useful to you than to Cascade. In the sense that you should make it read the documents every time, in every conversation, and if you do it with a premium model you will only consume credits for this. So, here's my example: I have my workspace ""Modulandia"", inside the workspace I have 3 folders: Modulandia, Context, Appunti.
Modulandia is the project folder, it contains the code, the build folder... Context is the folder with the .md files that I prepare for Cascade. Appunti is a folder with .txt files that are exclusively useful to me (for example, a list of commands for the terminal).


How I recommend you use the .md files:
write them, make Cascade Base read them only once and ask it to create a memory. This way you don't have to make him read them later (unless you need to update them... for example if you have Changelog.md and the corresponding saved memory Changelog, update your .md file, delete the saved memory, tell him to read the .md file and create a memory with that information. You can also ask him to just update the memory, but it doesn't always work well and sometimes duplicate memories, so I always prefer to delete the memory and recreate it updated, so having the .md files is useful for you to keep control over the situation, once you have saved Cascade's memories, the .md files become useless for him).


How to mention files for context: mention specific files, for example @Main.cpp, @MainWindow.cpp etc... mentioning the folder doesn't help much, all Cascade will do is look at what files are inside the mentioned folder, then it will have to read those files... So if you mention the files directly, you save time and he saves effort.


Mentioning the folder can be useful when you don't even know where to look for something, situations like: function X should be in one of the files in the @Core folder. then Cascade will look at the files in the folder, try to figure out which file is most likely to contain that functionality, and search until it finds it. but you can do the same thing without mentioning folders and Cascade will simply search the entire workspace.",2025-03-09 03:20:29,3,0,0.0,Codeium,Agrume303,False,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j71p0a/how_to_properly_feed_multiple_api_docs_to_cascade/mgtz1q4/

>the .md documents are more useful to you than to Cascade

What do you mean? I've heard that a well-formatted structured markdown is the best format in which to convey a lot of information in an LLM context. There are two alternatives to do this in Windsurf: 1) ask this person via @ web to follow a link and read the api documentation web page, but this doesn't work well, I've tested it many times OR 2) drop chunks of documentation as is directly into the prompt, but this doesn't sound or look right.

>write them, make Cascade Base read them only once and ask it to create a memory

I don't write them myself, I parse them. That's a dozen different API providers and a bunch of method descriptions and code snippets.

For example, if I used R1, then switched to V3, it will also have the thinking process. If I used Sonnet 3.5  or 3.7 then switched to V3. Then it will also keep analyzing files and even take ""find"" action which I rarely see with V3. 

But after a few convos it will act strangely such as repeating the same sentence again and again without making any edit. 

I guess it's a bug that Codeium team will take seriously if it in fact calls Claude API instead of using the in-house V3 model when we are using a V3 model.",2025-03-12 07:49:21,1,2,1.0,Codeium,Personal-Expression3,True,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j9lqbq/v3_model_is_a_chameleon_but_an_inferior_one/
mh20uwv,,"- The file list update doesn't always work properly, I often find the same file duplicated when I have to mention a file in chat, maybe just because I renamed ""main"" to ""Main"" and I see both...
Sometimes just restart Windsurf and I get only the current files...sometimes a full reset is needed (delete the .codeium folder from Appdata, before doing that make sure you have a backup of the rules you set, because you will have to set them again, you will also have to set the Autocomplete and Terminal mode settings again, if you changed them, and of course all the memories you are still interested in, will have to be created again).


- If you don't specify the model you are using, it's hard to tell. Even though the base of Cascade is the engine of all models, each model will affect the behavior of Cascade differently. I guess it's 3.7, I often see the behavior you describe with 3.7. Often it thinks about the code, makes changes, then realizes it could have made them better, then changes again, then realizes it needs to look at more files to better understand the context, then realizes it needs to make more changes... By the time it's done, it's probably eaten 50 credits.


But 90% of the time you'll get the desired result without any compilation errors (or with a couple of small errors that will be fixed immediately).

## Introduction: The Core Concept of Vibe Coding with AI  

### What is Vibe Coding and What Does It Stand On?  
Vibe coding is a collaborative approach to software development where humans guide AI models (e.g., Claude 3.7, Cursor) to build functional projects efficiently. Introduced by Matthew Berman in his ""Vibe Coding Tutorial and Best Practices"" (YouTube, 2025), it rests on three pillars:  
1. **Specification:** You define the goal (e.g., ""Build a Twitter clone with login"").  
2. **Rules:** You set explicit constraints (e.g., ""Use Python, avoid complexity"").  
3. **Oversight:** You monitor and steer the process to ensure alignment.  

This manual builds on Berman’s foundation, integrating community insights from YouTube comments (e.g., u/nufh, u/robistocco) and Reddit threads (e.g., u/illusionst, u/DonkeyBonked), creating a comprehensive framework for developers of all levels.

### Why Is This Framework Useful?  
AI models are powerful but prone to chaos—over-engineering, scope creep, or losing context. This manual addresses these issues:  
- **Tames Chaos:** Enforces strict adherence to your rules, minimizing runaway behavior.  
- **Saves Time:** Structured steps and summaries reduce rework.  
- **Enables Clarity:** Non-technical users can follow along; programmers gain precision.  

### Key Benefits  
1. **Clarity:** Rules are modular, making them easy to navigate and adjust.  
2. **Control:** You dictate the pace and scope of AI actions.  
3. **Scalability:** Works for small scripts (e.g., a calculator) or large apps (e.g., a web platform).  
4. **Maintainability:** Documentation and tracking ensure long-term project viability.  

---

## Manual Structure: How It’s Organized  
The framework consists of four files in a `.cursor/rules` directory (or equivalent, e.g., Windsurf), each with a distinct purpose:  
1. **Coding Preferences** – Defines code style and quality standards.  
2. **Technical Stack** – Specifies tools and technologies.  
3. **Workflow Preferences** – Governs the AI’s process and execution.  
4. **Communication Preferences** – Sets expectations for AI-human interaction.  

We’ll start with basics for accessibility, then dive into advanced details for technical depth.

---

## Core Rules: A Simple Starting Point  

### 1. Coding Preferences – ""Write Code Like This""  
**Purpose:** Ensures clean, maintainable, and efficient code.  
**Rules:**  
- **Simplicity:** ""Always prioritize the simplest solution over complexity."" *(Matthew Berman)*  
- **No Duplication:** ""Avoid repeating code; reuse existing functionality when possible."" *(Matthew Berman, DRY from u/DonkeyBonked)*  
- **Organization:** ""Keep files concise, under 200-300 lines; refactor as needed."" *(Matthew Berman)*  
- **Documentation:** ""After major components, write a brief summary in `/docs/[component].md` (e.g., `login.md`)."" *(u/believablybad)*  

**Why It Works:** Simple code reduces bugs; documentation provides a readable audit trail.

### 2. Technical Stack – ""Use These Tools""  
**Purpose:** Locks the AI to your preferred technologies.  
**Rules (Berman’s Example):**  
- ""Backend in Python.""  
- ""Frontend in HTML and JavaScript.""  
- ""Store data in SQL databases, never JSON files.""  
- ""Write tests in Python.""  

**Why It Works:** Consistency prevents AI from switching tools mid-project.

### 3. Workflow Preferences – ""Work This Way""  
**Purpose:** Controls the AI’s execution process for predictability.  
- **Focus:** ""Modify only the code I specify; leave everything else untouched."" *(Matthew Berman)*  
- **Steps:** ""Break large tasks into stages; pause after each for my approval."" *(u/xmontc)*  
- **Planning:** ""Before big changes, write a `plan.md` and await my confirmation."" *(u/RKKMotorsports)*  
- **Tracking:** ""Log completed work in `progress.md` and next steps in `TODO.txt`."" *(u/illusionst, u/petrhlavacek)*  

**Why It Works:** Incremental steps and logs keep the process transparent and manageable.

### 4. Communication Preferences – ""Talk to Me Like This""  
**Purpose:** Ensures clear, actionable feedback from the AI.  
- **Summaries:** ""After each component, summarize what’s done."" *(u/illusionst)*  
- **Change Scale:** ""Classify changes as Small, Medium, or Large."" *(u/illusionst)*  
- **Clarification:** ""If my request is unclear, ask me before proceeding."" *(u/illusionst)*  

**Why It Works:** You stay informed without needing to decipher AI intent.

## Advanced Rules: Scaling Up for Complex Projects  

### 1. Coding Preferences – Enhancing Quality  
**Extensions:**  
- **Principles:** ""Follow SOLID principles (e.g., single responsibility, dependency inversion) where applicable."" *(u/Yodukay, u/philip_laureano)*  
- **Guardrails:** ""Never use mock data in dev or prod—restrict it to tests."" *(Matthew Berman)*  
- **Context Check:** ""Begin every response with a random emoji (e.g., 🐙) to confirm context retention."" *(u/evia89)*  
- **Efficiency:** ""Optimize outputs to minimize token usage without sacrificing clarity."" *(u/Puzzleheaded-Age-660)*  

**Technical Insight:** SOLID ensures modularity (e.g., a login module doesn’t handle tweets); emoji signal when context exceeds model limits (typically 200k tokens for Claude 3.7).  
**Credits:** Matthew Berman (base), u/DonkeyBonked (DRY), u/philip_laureano (SOLID), u/evia89 (emoji), u/Puzzleheaded-Age-660 (tokens).

### 2. Technical Stack – Customization  
**Extensions:**  
- ""If I specify additional tools (e.g., Elasticsearch for search), include them here."" *(Matthew Berman)*  
- ""Never alter the stack without my explicit approval."" *(Matthew Berman)*  

**Technical Insight:** A fixed stack prevents AI from introducing incompatible dependencies (e.g., switching SQL to JSON).  
**Credits:** Matthew Berman (original stack).

### 3. Workflow Preferences – Process Mastery  
**Extensions:**  
- **Testing:** ""Include comprehensive tests for major features; suggest edge case tests (e.g., invalid inputs)."" *(u/illusionst)*  
- **Context Management:** ""If context exceeds 100k tokens, summarize into `context-summary.md` and restart the session."" *(u/Minimum_Art_2263, u/orbit99za)*  
- **Adaptability:** ""Adjust checkpoint frequency based on my feedback (more/less granularity)."" *(u/illusionst)*  

**Technical Insight:** Token limits (e.g., Claude’s 200k) degrade performance beyond 100k; summaries maintain continuity. Tests catch regressions early.  
**Credits:** Matthew Berman (focus), u/xmontc (steps), u/RKKMotorsports (planning), u/illusionst (summaries, tests), u/Minimum_Art_2263 (context).

### 4. Communication Preferences – Precision Interaction  
**Extensions:**  
- **Planning:** ""For Large changes, provide an implementation plan and wait for approval."" *(u/illusionst)*  
- **Tracking:** ""Always state what’s completed and what’s pending."" *(u/illusionst)*  
- **Emotional Cues:** ""If I indicate urgency (e.g., ‘This is critical—don’t mess up!’), prioritize care and precision."" *(u/dhamaniasad, u/capecoderrr)*  

**Technical Insight:** Change classification (S/M/L) quantifies impact (e.g., Small = <50 lines, Large = architecture shift); emotional cues may leverage training data patterns for better compliance.  
**Credits:** u/illusionst (summaries, classification), u/dhamaniasad (emotional prompts).

---

## Practical Example: How It Works  
**Task:** ""Build a note-taking app with save functionality.""  

1. **Specification:** You say, ""I want an app to write and save notes.""  
2. **AI Response:**  
   - ""🦋 Understood. Plan: 1. Backend (Python, SQL storage), 2. Frontend (HTML/JS), 3. Save function. Proceed?""  
   - You: ""Yes.""  
3. **Execution:**  
   - After backend: ""🐳 Backend done (Medium change). Notes saved in SQL. Updated `progress.md` and `TODO.txt`. Next: frontend?""  
   - After frontend: ""🌟 Frontend complete. Added `docs/notes.md` with usage. Done!""  
4. **Outcome:** A working app with logs (`progress.md`, `/docs`) for reference.  

**Technical Note:** Each step is testable (e.g., SQL insert works), and context is preserved via summaries.

---

## Advanced Tips: Maximizing the Framework  

### Why Four Files?  
- **Modularity:** Each file isolates a concern—style, tools, process, communication—for easy updates. *(Matthew Berman)*  
- **Scalability:** Adjust one file without disrupting others (e.g., tweak communication without touching stack). *(u/illusionst)*  

### Customization Options  
- **Beginners:** Skip advanced rules (e.g., SOLID) for simplicity.  
- **Teams:** Add `team-collaboration.mdc`: ""Align with team conventions in `team-standards.md`; summarize for peers."" *(u/deleatanda5910)*  
- **Large Projects:** Increase checkpoints and documentation frequency.  

### Emotional Prompting  
- Try: ""This project is critical—please focus!"" Anecdotal evidence suggests improved attention, possibly from training data biases. *(u/capecoderrr, u/dhamaniasad)*

mgjay9q,,"I tried Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Cline (and its fork Roo Code, which is more or less the same). All assistants in this list are paid except the last one. They all are similar in their functionality:

* they can see your project structure and access files
* they don't just respond to users' requests in one shot but first plan the work, ask questions or load files they think they need, then do code changes, then review, then edit their solution, etc
* they offer code changes as a diff in an IDE so users can review and accept, reject or reject with a comment
* they can work in a terminal to create/delete/move files, search files by names or by the content. Or to build the project, run it, run tests. If you ask not just work on something but to verify it, they will work in a loop by making changes and verifying them, reading errors and repeating until they manage to achieve a successful result
* there are other functions like MCP servers support (you can add web search for example), but the items above are the core features

There is another category of assistants that are more autonomous: Aider, Claude Code, Junie. You have fewer options to interrupt and provide feedback. So they make more decisions on their own, focusing on end-to-end solutions. Like, you give them a task, and they work for 30 min on a complete application. Some people prefer those, but I like the iterative approach where I review each step and each code change in IDE.

I ended up with Cline / Roo Code because it's free and because I can configure it to use internally hosted models. Nothing I can run locally at home really works with it, but I have some full-size models at work, and I can use them for free in my assistant. All the other assistants don't like letting me override a base URL. But they include some credits and some amount of free API calls in their subscriptions, so it might be cheaper in some cases. This doesn't work for me because I want to use Claude Sonned 3.7 all the time.

1j62zn0,"Roo Code 3.8 - 🪃 Boomerang Tasks, Smarter Diff Edits, Multi-Window Support & More","For those of you who are not familiar with Roo Code, it is a free 'AI Coding Agent' VS Code extension. 

I will keep this short, but let me say that this is such a big release that if we were Windsurf, we would be calling this 4.0. 😉

## 🪃 Boomerang Tasks

* When using new_task, the child task now returns a summary to its parent task upon calling attempt_completion, allowing the parent task to hand off work and get results back automatically. (Thanks shaybc!)

## 🔬 Multi-Block Diff Edits

* Add a smarter experimental diff editing strategy that applies multiple diff edits at once (thanks qdaxb!)

This will soon become the default diff editing strategy, but we're doing a soft rollout as ""experimental"" to make sure we didn't miss anything during our testing. It seems to work really well!

## 🪟 Multi-Window Support

* Support running Roo in multiple editor windows simultaneously (thanks samhvw8!)

## 📁 .rooignore Support

* Add support for a .rooignore to prevent Roo Code from read/writing certain files (with a setting to also exclude them from search/lists) (thanks u/mrubens + Cline!)

## 🤝 Human Relay

* Add a new ""Human Relay"" provider that allows you to manually copy information to a Web AI when needed, and then paste the AI's response back into Roo Code (thanks NyxJae!)

## 📊 Telemetry

* Added opt-in telemetry to collect anonymous usage data, helping us improve Roo Code faster. This is optional, and you can disable it anytime. [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code/blob/main/PRIVACY.md) (thanks u/mrubens + Cline!)

## 🎨 UX Improvements

* Redesign the settings page to make it easier to navigate (thanks cte!)
* Make checkpoints asynchronous and exclude more files to speed them up (thanks cte!)
* Improve UI for mode/provider selectors in chat (thanks u/mrubens!)
* Improve styling of the task headers (thanks monotykamary!)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

* Fix terminal overload / gray screen of death, and other terminal issues (thanks cte!)
* Improve context mention path handling on Windows (thanks samhvw8!)

## 🤖 Provider Support

* Add credential-based authentication for Vertex AI, enabling users to easily switch between Google Cloud accounts (thanks eonghk!)
* Update the DeepSeek provider with the correct baseUrl and track caching correctly (thanks olweraltuve!)
* Add observability for OpenAI providers (thanks refactorthis!)
* Support speculative decoding for LM Studio local models (thanks adamwlarson!)

I'm considering switching from Cursor. Checkpoints aren't working for me and there have been reports of the models not functioning effectively through Cursor (I think Cursor edits/abbreviates messages in the backend to save their API costs).

mhf5r5x,,"Full transparency I work at Cline, but wanted to share my perspective:

Checkpoints are very effective in Cline, especially after our recent 2.0 update, which significantly boosted speed and drastically reduced storage needs.

One key difference is that Cline is usage-based instead of subscription-based (i.e. Cline's not cutting corners on your inference). This means it actively seeks more relevant context from your codebase and engages with you directly, creating a more responsive, agentic experience. However, depending on your usage (especially with 3.7 Sonnet), costs might exceed a fixed monthly subscription like Cursor's $20/month. A solid cost-saving alternative is leveraging high-quality yet more affordable models from DeepSeek or Gemini.

Regarding MCP, Cline has some underrated capabilities here. There's an integrated marketplace allowing you to easily connect to hundreds of servers. Additionally, Cline excels in building MCP servers—I've even created a .clinerules protocol designed specifically to simplify building custom MCP servers (https://docs.cline.bot/mcp-servers/mcp-server-from-scratch).

Overall, there's amazing innovation happening in this space right now. Cursor, Windsurf, and Cline are all bringing unique strengths to the table.

1j71ou6,Local .md API docs knowledgebase. How to properly feed it to LLM?,"Hey I’m building a web app an API aggregator for a specific topic with a unified simple UI. Something like OpenRouter /chat page, but for a different topic. Different API providers have completely different sets of methods, some use their own Python libraries, others work via HTTP GET/POST. I want to encapsulate each API in a separate library (class?) so my app interacts with all APIs the same way and I can easily integrate new API providers.

To achieve this, I started collecting a directory of markdown API docs for each provider, so the LLM has direct access to the documentation.

1. Is this a good idea overall? Creating a local markdown knowledge base as the way to give LLM access to API docs?

2. How should I structure and store the .md docs to make it easier for the LLM to find what it needs? Is it better to split docs into smaller .md files (\~100 lines / 3,000 chars) OR keep everything in one API Provider = one large .md file (\~700 lines / 20,000 chars) with all methods structured under H1, H2, H3? What works best for LLM?

3. And the main question. How do I properly feed the docs into the context? Should I @ mention a specific file or the entire docs folder in the prompt? Should I add a @ mention for the whole /api-docs folder in rules file? Could MCP help with this somehow?

mgyi37q,,"With gh copilot i just chuck the doc in the context as long as its below ~40k token. The context window is now big enough to do that. Cursor/windsurf you can’t, I think their context window is really small (~30k). 

4o on Copilot is 128k token. Sonnet is similar. So you still have ~50k token to chat and attach file before it start forgetting about the documentation, which is plenty, at least for me

Here how I do it:

I use this: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_reusable-prompt-files-experimental

So you can use a keyboard shortcut to search them and load them in context. I basically copy/paste the documentation in the prompt file. Seems to work fine up to around 40k token. You can check the size of your doc with https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer

If it’s too big, I chunk it in topic.

It actually work much better than Cursor Docs which only get access to a summary of the doc. You can confirm that it’s loaded by asking very specific question to copilot, works like charm for me.

Here a small trick: load the prompt (doc) on the first prompt, then once copilot answer it’s loaded in the context, remove the prompt and then load your files and ask your questions.",2025-03-09 19:17:58,1,0,0.0,ChatGPTCoding,debian3,False,Reddit (r/ChatGPTCoding),https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1j71ou6/local_md_api_docs_knowledgebase_how_to_properly/mgyi37q/
