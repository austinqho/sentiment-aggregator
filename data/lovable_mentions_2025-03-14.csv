1j6d84j,Best AI for Programming (2025-03),"Hey all, I've been using free-tier AI tools pretty intensively over the past few months to support my work and daily life. About 70% of my usage is for programming, and the rest is for other stuff. I’ve been jumping between tools like ChatGPT, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Deepseek—mostly because one of them is usually down or hits its limit when I need it.

Recently, I discovered Lovable dev (along with similar options like Bolt and v0) and gave it a try—pretty impressive stuff 😅. Now I'm feeling a bit stuck on which one is really worth upgrading to a paid subscription.

Any thoughts or suggestions? Also, if anyone’s got a setup that mixes two or more free AIs or even self-hosting options (whether on your own hardware or a rented server), I'm all ears.

1j5d8j5,What's the correct way to manage billing and payments?,"Hi,

Can anyone advise what the most common approach is to track customer balances?

Let's say, one of the following examples: tenants rent, tuition payments, donor pledges etc. 

I usually just have a single table, with a column for the Dues and a column for Amount In (payments). 

Is this the recommended method? Or would you rather have a separate table for the bills and separate for payments?

Also, if I want to link the payments to bills, is there an easy and efficient way for the user to click on a payment, or in the form of a new payment have a list of bills that need to be paid and automatically apply an amount to each bill? I've done something like this in appsheet but it was basically adding multiple rows, each allocation on a separate row. So if a payment covered five invoices/bills I had to add a new row for each bill allocation. 

Now I'm playing around with Lovable.dev and want to create something more user friendly.

1jaygyy,Learn JavaScript or soon obsolete with AI tools?,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently exploring startup ideas, mainly around web applications, and I have a big question about learning to code.

With the rise of platforms like Lovable, Bolt, Cursor, and Supabase, which speed up MVP development using vibe coding, is it still worth spending months learning JavaScript?

Honestly, I don’t want to invest 3–4 months learning it only to realize that in 6 months or a year, my skills are already outdated because these tools make development much faster, even for non-advanced coders. Is JavaScript still a valuable asset in this context, or should I focus on Python instead (especially for AI and back-end development)?

I also feel like AI integration has become almost mandatory for standing out in today’s startup world. For those who have launched a project, do you think it’s essential, or can a well-designed product still succeed without AI?

Lastly, if any of you have built a startup without technical skills or a network of developers, I’d love to hear your experience. How did you overcome that challenge?

It first frustrated me because of ""Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code"" error and now there's something called bycrypt error in edge functions which Lovable isnt able to solve.

The weird fact is I've enabled email authentication already. In my food delivery website there are two sign up routes: one as a seller and one as a customer. I first made the sign up workflow for seller, it worked perfectly,I am still getting confirmation mails from supabase everytime I try registering with a new email id. Its sign up and login works perfectly. But when I asked it to do the same thing for customers too, it's not being able to do it.

1itgshg,💡 [Help] Can’t Create an Admin User & Access /admin with Supabase + Lovable,"Hey, I’m currently building a web application using Supabase and Lovable. My goal is to:

• Create an admin user who has permissions to access /admin and manage content.

• Ensure that my email has the “admin” role so I can log in and access the dashboard.

However, I’m running into major issues:

1. I can’t properly assign the “admin” role when creating a new user with Supabase Auth. I get endless error loops when trying to integrate it with Lovable.

2. In the Supabase dashboard, I can’t manually set a new password for my email. It seems like password resets only work through magic links or reset password emails, but neither of them is working for me.

3. Every attempt to implement role-based access (checking user roles before allowing access to /admin) leads to authentication issues or infinite loops.

Questions:

• What’s the best way to assign the “admin” role to a specific email on account creation in Supabase?

• How can I manually set/reset a password for my account in the Supabase dashboard?

• How do you properly check the user’s role before granting access to /admin in a Supabase + Lovable setup?

It wont fetch my organization anymore, it wont fetch team members. They are there in the backend, but it just wont fetch it.

**What ive tried so far:**

\- Redefining the RLS policies

\- Changing to a flattened approach

\- Changing to Materialized approach

\- The JWT thing

\- Updated the Site URL and redericting URLs to match the Vite URL

  
Lovable has suggested countless solutions ive tried out, but i still get the same issue.

Does anyone have suggestions or solutions?

1ixaid1,Help : Having issues using the extensions.http_post or net.http_post to trigger Twilio Whatsapp Template.,"**Context -**   
  
I've used supabase for a month now (no prior coding experience), and so far it's been fairly straightforward to create the database/functions and interact with my web app (via Lovable).

I've integrated Twilio Verify (for WhatsApp signups via OTP), but I'm having issues with the Content Template Builder.

As per Twilio docs (https://www.twilio.com/docs/content/send-templates-created-with-the-content-template-builder) - it seems pretty straightforward. I've managed to trigger it correctly via postman.

    CONTENT_VARIABLES_OBJ=$(cat << EOF
    {
      ""1"": ""Name""
    }
    EOF
    )
    curl -X POST ""https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/$TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json"" \
    --data-urlencode ""ContentSid=HXXXXXXXXX"" \
    --data-urlencode ""To=whatsapp:+18551234567"" \
    --data-urlencode ""From=whatsapp:+15551234567"" \
    --data-urlencode ""ContentVariables=$CONTENT_VARIABLES_OBJ"" \
    -u $TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN

**Issues -** 

However, once I start trying to use the http\_post extension, or the pg\_net http\_post, I'm having issues with sending the right authorization headers.

    {""code"":20003,""message"":""Authenticate"",""more_info"":""https://www.twilio.com/docs/errors/20003"",""status"":401}

    {""code"":20003,""message"":""Authentication Error - No credentials provided"",""more_info"":""https://www.twilio.com/docs/errors/20003"",""status"":401}
    

I've tried those two, as well as the database webhook to try to make a simple(?) http post, but the AI doesn't seem too helpful when it comes to structuring the request properly, and I'm sort of stuck.

I didn't try the Edge Functions yet (seems a bit daunting, but I guess I'll give it a go tomorrow), especially since I think I'm sort of on the right track - and it looks like a simple syntax issue.

**Function -**

A lot of the variables are hard coded, I can fix by myself later, but it seems like the core issue is around passing the Authorization headers. I've tried several variations for the arguments. Here's my latest one.

    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.send_whatsapp_message()

            ),
            'MessagingServiceSid', 'MG6XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'  -- Hardcoded Messaging Service SID
        );
    
      -- Prepare headers as JSONB, including the authorization header directly
        headers := jsonb_build_object(
            'Authorization', 'Basic ' || encode(convert_to('ACCOUNT_SID:AUTH_TOKEN', 'UTF8'), 'base64'),
            'Content-Type', 'application/json'
        );
    
        -- Make the HTTP POST request using net.http_post
        response := net.http_post(
            'https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json',  -- URL
            data,  -- Pass the data as JSONB
            '{}'::jsonb,
            headers,  -- Pass the headers directly
            5000
        );
    
        RETURN response;  -- Return the response from the HTTP request
    
    EXCEPTION
        WHEN OTHERS THEN
            RAISE NOTICE 'Error sending WhatsApp message: %', SQLERRM;
            RETURN jsonb_build_object('success', false, 'message', SQLERRM);  -- Return error message
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

I've also run the function (without calling the http\_post) to see whether there was an issue with the arguments when submitted, but it seems fine to me?
