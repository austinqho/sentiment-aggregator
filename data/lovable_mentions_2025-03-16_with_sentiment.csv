1j5d8j5,What's the correct way to manage billing and payments?,"Hi,

Can anyone advise what the most common approach is to track customer balances?

Let's say, one of the following examples: tenants rent, tuition payments, donor pledges etc. 

I usually just have a single table, with a column for the Dues and a column for Amount In (payments). 

Is this the recommended method? Or would you rather have a separate table for the bills and separate for payments?

Also, if I want to link the payments to bills, is there an easy and efficient way for the user to click on a payment, or in the form of a new payment have a list of bills that need to be paid and automatically apply an amount to each bill? I've done something like this in appsheet but it was basically adding multiple rows, each allocation on a separate row. So if a payment covered five invoices/bills I had to add a new row for each bill allocation. 

Now I'm playing around with Lovable.dev and want to create something more user friendly.

Questions Whats the best way to assign the admin role to a specific email on account creation in Supabase? How can I manually setreset a password for my account in the Supabase dashboard? How do you properly check the users role before granting access to admin in a Supabase Lovable setup? Would really appreciate any guidance or working examples!

Im building a order management platform for the construction industry with lovable. I have no experiance with coding, but things are still coming together nicely.

I have one issue i have been battling for days now and nothing seems to work.

  
**From the console:**

**The issue:**

It wont fetch my organization anymore, it wont fetch team members. They are there in the backend, but it just wont fetch it.

**What ive tried so far:**

\- Redefining the RLS policies

\- Changing to a flattened approach

\- Changing to Materialized approach

\- The JWT thing

\- Updated the Site URL and redericting URLs to match the Vite URL

1ixaid1,Help : Having issues using the extensions.http_post or net.http_post to trigger Twilio Whatsapp Template.,"**Context -**   
  
I've used supabase for a month now (no prior coding experience), and so far it's been fairly straightforward to create the database/functions and interact with my web app (via Lovable).

I've integrated Twilio Verify (for WhatsApp signups via OTP), but I'm having issues with the Content Template Builder.

As per Twilio docs (https://www.twilio.com/docs/content/send-templates-created-with-the-content-template-builder) - it seems pretty straightforward. I've managed to trigger it correctly via postman.

    CONTENT_VARIABLES_OBJ=$(cat << EOF
    {
      ""1"": ""Name""
    }
    EOF
    )
    curl -X POST ""https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/$TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json"" \
    --data-urlencode ""ContentSid=HXXXXXXXXX"" \
    --data-urlencode ""To=whatsapp:+18551234567"" \
    --data-urlencode ""From=whatsapp:+15551234567"" \
    --data-urlencode ""ContentVariables=$CONTENT_VARIABLES_OBJ"" \
    -u $TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN

**Issues -** 

However, once I start trying to use the http\_post extension, or the pg\_net http\_post, I'm having issues with sending the right authorization headers.

    {""code"":20003,""message"":""Authenticate"",""more_info"":""https://www.twilio.com/docs/errors/20003"",""status"":401}

    {""code"":20003,""message"":""Authentication Error - No credentials provided"",""more_info"":""https://www.twilio.com/docs/errors/20003"",""status"":401}
    

I've tried those two, as well as the database webhook to try to make a simple(?) http post, but the AI doesn't seem too helpful when it comes to structuring the request properly, and I'm sort of stuck.

I didn't try the Edge Functions yet (seems a bit daunting, but I guess I'll give it a go tomorrow), especially since I think I'm sort of on the right track - and it looks like a simple syntax issue.

**Function -**

A lot of the variables are hard coded, I can fix by myself later, but it seems like the core issue is around passing the Authorization headers. I've tried several variations for the arguments. Here's my latest one.

    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.send_whatsapp_message()

            'Content-Type', 'application/json'
        );
    
        -- Make the HTTP POST request using net.http_post

    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

I've also run the function (without calling the http\_post) to see whether there was an issue with the arguments when submitted, but it seems fine to me?
