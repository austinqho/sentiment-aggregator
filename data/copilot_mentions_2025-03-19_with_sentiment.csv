1. Will the agents feature cost extra to regular copilot? Will there be faster and slower requests depending on your subscription? A ballpark figure would be fine
1. Will the agents feature allow selecting different AI models to send questions to?
1. When do you guess this is going to move to stable? Ballpark figure is fine as well, I understand there can be a long road ahead.
1. Why is it called Copilot when under the hood it uses the Claude model? I thought all Copilot branding from Microsoft uses the ChatGPT and other OpenAI models?
1. Are there third party AI assistants you look at for inspiration and what features you saw them implement that you just had to have?
1. Will there be a solution to automatically import dependencies with autocomplete or do you really rely on agents to do that?
1. Will Copilot in the future implement eslint/stylelint/htmlhint and other linters to write the code how you want it?

mes4fe3,,"Thanks for interesting questions. Let me answer, but keep in mind that this is my personal point of view as a VS Code product manager.  
1. Right now I am not aware of any no plans to change the cost structure. So agent mode will be available to Free/Pro/Business/Enterprise.

2. It already allows (claude 3.5, 3.7, gpt-4o) - give it a try!

3. I already answered that in this discussion. Rough estimate mid-March

4. This is a more of a marketing / branding question. But just because it is called Copilot does not mean it must only talk to OpenAI models. I do not think we as MS ever made that statement for any of the Copilot products.

5. We already get a large amount of user feedback / feature requests. So as always just listening to our users gives us enough signals to decide what to do next

6. Regular suggestions (non AI ones) can auto import on accept sometimes. It makes sense that GH Copilot supports this. Please file a feature request [https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release) and ping me at isidorn

7. Agent mode already listens on lint / error changes via the getErrors tool and auto-corrects

8. We already have a Chat and Language Model extensibility story [https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release) and [https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model) and we continuously try to expand our API surfaces. So tell us what you would like to see, and share your scenarios!

9. Per each API we decide if we want to finalise it and expose it to all extensions or not. So far we have finalised: completions, chat, language model, shell integration (that Cline extension send kudos to us for doing). Having said that there are still APIs that are proposed and not possible to be used by all 3rd party extensions.

mdycao6,,"On my side - Copilot is still not that effective for me as Cursor is, even after the last update with agentic flow Copilot looks closer to Cursor but autocomplete in diff view didn't work well for me, i gonna try again if that's fixed, and also i'm trying to find a good usage for my Copilot subscription in Nvim (my most favorite code editor), i have a Cursor subscription because the pricing is far better then other options, unlimited requests just for $10!  
   
Really have a pain to use VS Code, switch to Nvim to investigate the codebase and back to VS - but Cursor work too good for my coding needs and improves my workflow dramatically, i wasn't possible to build so huge updates on large projects and cover them with tests. I stopped to hate my colleagues for code review comments and happy to implement requested updates and tests )) Cursor pricing is quite worse then Copilot and you're limited with 500 credits per month.

The worse experience been with Windsurf - totally unexpected for me as i'm a big fan of their Codeium free autocomplete extension and using it for years, it's very good!

I find copilot to be too slow to provide autocomplete. With Cody you can just keep pressing tab and it will continue writing stuff that is useful. Tabnine isn't too far off. Both have unlimited completions for a fixed monthly fee. Copilot is going to get better but overall is still very slow. Both in chat responses and in autocomplete. If they fix that, I would return. Cline is very useful in its automation, much like Cursor.

And Cline basically does the same thing. I have it set up with Claude 3.7 through Openrouter and its fine.

Overall with chat I notice that too often it still comes back to the same solutions that don't work. It also often provides outdated suggestions for API's that are already changed or renamed. And even though I have a lot of stuff in my context that I always use, it still frequently ignores stuff and uses more common code style and stuff that I just dislike for it being very basic and not very standardized (like not having any ESLint/Prettier/Stylistic improvements). For testing it frequently suggests using stuff from a different library and it hardly ever looks at my enums, constants and interfaces to see what the value might look like.

Autocomplete works best if you provide a comment on what you want to autocomplete.

Like, if you give it a comment like `// here is a list of cars with red, blue, green and yellow paint` it will immediately suggest `paint: ""red""` as the first one and so on. Which is why I now have a lot more comments in my code as it just helps with generation (though I still remove plenty when I'm done). I also often ask it to provide proof or links to documentation first before I accept his suggestions so I know it doesn't just make shit up.

If you’re jumping into AI coding assistants for VSCode in 2025, here’s the rundown:

GitHub Copilot is still the default choice, now with support for multiple AI models (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.).

Tabnine is decent if you want AI completions but care about privacy (local and cloud models available).

Cursor is actually a VSCode fork, not just an extension. It’s basically VSCode but with AI baked into the editor itself—code generation, refactoring, explanations, etc. If you want AI fully integrated rather than just a plugin, it’s worth checking out.


If you’re already used to VSCode, Copilot is probably the easiest to start with, but Cursor is an interesting option if you want AI at every level.

🌟 **Hello Vim Enthusiasts!** 🌟

As a fellow Vim lover, I’ve built **vscode-vim-mode** to gently bridge Vim’s efficiency with VS Code’s modern features. If you’re curious about blending these worlds, I’d be honored if you gave it a try.

👉 **What it offers**:

* **Lightweight Vim/Neovim integration** without disrupting your VS Code workflow (Copilot, extensions, etc).
* **Peaceful coexistence**: Runs alongside plugins like VSCodeVim or VSCodeNeovim.
* **Simple toggle**: Switch modes with a button or command—no complexity.
* **Optional save sync**: For Neovim users, quietly trigger formatting on save.

This is a small attempt to serve the Vim community. If it makes even one coder’s day smoother, I’ll consider it worthwhile.

📦 **If you’d like to explore**:

* [Install via VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wy-z.vscode-vim-mode)
* [View or contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/wy-z/vscode-vim-mode)

**Thank you** for your time—and if you run into any issues or have suggestions, please feel free to reach out. Your feedback would mean a lot!

*Happy coding, and may your keystrokes stay efficient!* 🚀

I've been using VS Code and GitHub Copilot Agent, and it's really streamlined my coding process. It's almost like coding has turned into just writing prompts instead of actual code. I always double-check everything, but it’s definitely made things faster.

1ixl5p5,Mermaid Diagrams from code,"I made a thingy over the weekend that I thought y'all might like. It's an extension to generate mermaid diagrams from code. It uses an LLM to generate the diagram and renders it in a side window in VS-code. 

I had something like this running on the side to better understand copilot generated code and figured I might as well turn it into an integration. 

For now it uses just Sambanova for the LLM (super fast, plus free trial available ). But it would be easy enough to extend it with other LLMs. Its bring your own API key only. 

I am also working on V2 that can scan the whole code base and create diagrams of how everything connects.

I used to have the same idea, until I noticed that what students learning with notepad was struggling with, was syntax, forgetting semicolons or brackets, or closing tags, where as what students learning with actual modern editors was struggling with, was understanding how to most effectively solve the problems given in the assignments.

What finally convinced me of the stupidity of the ""better learn it the simple way first"" was when I had a class that was taught with all the fancy plugins, getting rainbow-colored bracket-matching, automatic indentation, automatic tag-closing, automatic formatting and automatic highlighting of compile and validation errors, as well as syntax highlighting. After their first semester another class started with one of the notepad-teachers, and some of the students that had been learning with all the modern tools were employed as teaching assistants. They could easily spot errors in syntax (indentation, missing closing etc.) in the notepad-students' work, and help them fix it - even though they didn't have all the fancy tools at their disposal. And they soon realized that these poor students weren't learning programming, but were learning how to structure and format code correctly - and the new students never reached the same level as the ones with the fancy tools.

I produced my assignment by hand coding the html as we all do, and the teacher thought to mock me in front of the class for not using the Dreamweaver wysiwyg (which there was no requirement to do)


But this point I'd produced several landing pages and a couple of non-trivial tech projects at work.


So I explained to the teacher that I was already employed for over a year and doing this is a real world setting, that no one is using Dreamweaver professionally, that the senior team I brought my assignments to were laughing at them.


After class I was asked to stay behind, HE wanted to lecture me about embarrassing him. I showed him my job offer, salary and a couple of projects. then went to faculty management explaining what had happened.


To cut this off short, he was replaced immediately, and I got full credit for the paper using a work project that was already complete.

mg6kmdk,,"Following that roadmap will not make you an intermediate developer. It *might* get you to junior level, depending on how diligent you are.

Assume 2000-4000 hours worth of study and practice to get to maybe being hirable as a junior, and 5000 hours worth of professional experience after that to be intermediate. Expect to take 4-5 years to become hirable as a junior (that's about how long a B.Sc. in CS will take you, plus maybe an internship), and another 3-5 years of working full time as a programmer beyond that to hit intermediate.

>I’m using GitHub Copilot, and it feels like it does a lot of the work for me. Do I really need to go through all of this learning when AI is advancing so quickly?

So, a lot of people talk about AI eliminating junior roles and I don't know how true that actually is or not.

I’m a mid-level full-stack engineer with **3 years of experience**, mainly working with **React, Node.js, and AWS**, and I’m currently looking for my next role in **London**. The interview process has been a bit of a rollercoaster—every company seems to have a completely different approach, and I’m struggling to figure out how to prepare efficiently.

So far, I’ve come across:

* **LeetCode-style DS&A questions** (fairly standard, but still hit-or-miss on difficulty)
* **Verbal technical deep dives** (these range from broad discussions to very specific knowledge checks)
* **Pair programming sessions** (this is where I feel the least prepared)

I also find it harder and more daunting because I feel like I’ve become reliant on Copilot, and writing code from my own head seems much harder now.

But honestly, it all comes down to the **prompts**! The better your prompts, the better the results. AI can’t magically create perfect solutions on its own—it needs clear guidance.

That’s exactly why I’m building **SynergyCoder**—a tool where you can **dynamically create coding prompts** for tools like Cursor and Copilot. It’s all about making it easier to get consistent, high-quality results without constantly rewriting prompts.

1it3dhk,[Partially Rant] I truly want to use AI but..,"Hello everyone. I'm actually using ChatGPT and Copilot to help me in my daily job. Since now I just used those to help me write basic functions as some sort of personal assistant. Stuff like ""provide a function that sorts my array of objects given that specific logic"" or ""provide a boilerplate for that framework using that other framework"". This because I never managed to get something more usefull from an LLM. 

Cause people keep saying I'm the one who uses them bad I've spent the last 4 months trying to leverage LLM power to a further level...failing miserably. 

As a test project I'm now trying to convert a 3d engine I've already wrote in C++ to a webgl2 engine using typescript. I decided to use ChatGPT o1 and o3 since the beginning of the project hoping that the LLM could keep its own context updated by not needing to interpret some already existing sources. ChatGPT was able to provide a typescript project with the Hello World of 3d programming:  a working WebGL2  example with a static triangle. Nice! 

  
At this point problems arise.  As the project grew and modularity kicked in ChatGPT started allucinating badly. As every decent 3d engine works I split my Classes into modules. So now I have a Renderer class, a Scene class, a Mesh class, some Utility classes like CompileShaders, LoadTextures and so on. 

  
No matter how hard I try and how frequently I reupload my sources, ChatGPT keeps ""forgetting"" stuff he has provided and keeps writing (buggy) new code as the previous work never existed. I need a new shader? ChatGPT keeps writing private functions to load and compile shaders, even if I just reminded it he already provided a Utility class that specifically does that.  A texture? Let's rewrite the texture loading code instead of using the already existing one that ChatGPT itself provided. 

And BLODY HELL, I hate when it does an error and I need to keep telling it to not include that error. ""Hey that part is wrong, you should do it that way"" ""Ok"" And then, after one step, it keeps doing the same error I told it not to do.

I tried updating the context by explaining stuff, by re-uploading to ChatGPT the current sources, using single files, using an archive of the whole folder. Nothing works. It seems it can ""remember"" stuff it did for 1 or 2 steps then it restarts from scratch.

1j8d7rx,Upgrading Old PHP Website (PHP 5 → PHP 8.x) Using AI - Need Guidance,"Hey!

I’m currently upgrading an old PHP 5 website to the latest PHP version. I have all original files (public_html), including PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various include files. The website’s structure and appearance need to remain exactly the same—only backend code (mostly PHP) needs upgrading for compatibility and security.

I’ve used AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude extensively, but it’s becoming cumbersome due to context window limitations. Each new chat loses context about my project.

My Ideal Scenario:
	•	Upload the entire public_html folder somewhere (like GitHub).
	•	Have an AI (GitHub Copilot or something similar) analyze the entire folder, understand interdependencies among files, and help me update outdated PHP code seamlessly.
	•	Continuously test and ensure the website remains functional at every step.

I’ve heard good things about GitHub Copilot with Claude 3.7 Sonnet integration and Codespaces, but I’m not experienced enough to fully understand if this meets my needs. Can anyone experienced in upgrading legacy PHP sites using AI tools guide me?

Key Questions:
	•	Is GitHub Copilot Pro good enough to handle a full website upgrade from PHP 5 to latest versions?
	•	Can it maintain context across multiple files effectively?
	•	How do you practically test database connections and functionality within this AI-assisted workflow?
	•	Any pitfalls or better approaches?

Thanks in advance for any guidance!

mh5tyab,,"Man, I think they are concerned about the amount of work you will be doing vs the pay you will get out of it lol. Copilot isn't a static code analyzer afaik, so it cannot scan code and give you a report on deprecation and refactoring.

1j6d84j,Best AI for Programming (2025-03),"Hey all, I've been using free-tier AI tools pretty intensively over the past few months to support my work and daily life. About 70% of my usage is for programming, and the rest is for other stuff. I’ve been jumping between tools like ChatGPT, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Deepseek—mostly because one of them is usually down or hits its limit when I need it.

Recently, I discovered Lovable dev (along with similar options like Bolt and v0) and gave it a try—pretty impressive stuff 😅. Now I'm feeling a bit stuck on which one is really worth upgrading to a paid subscription.

Any thoughts or suggestions? Also, if anyone’s got a setup that mixes two or more free AIs or even self-hosting options (whether on your own hardware or a rented server), I'm all ears.
