1jgleof,Adding multiple private Github repos,"I have an Enterprise Starter account, and have been able to add some private Github repo from account A. Now I want to add some more private Github repos from account B. I click 'Add Organization', and I'm able to login to github account B, and add SourceGraph Starter app integration on the Github side. But I still cant' see the new repos on the Sourcegraph side. Some step I'm missing?",2025-03-21 12:48:35,1,2,1.0,sourcegraph,Creative-Drawer2565,True,Reddit (r/sourcegraph),https://www.reddit.com/r/sourcegraph/comments/1jgleof/adding_multiple_private_github_repos/
mj0t83n,,"Hi ðŸ‘‹   
  
Sourcegraph accounts can only be tied to one GitHub user which is why Account B is not getting added.  
The workaround here would be to add Account B's repos to an org that then Account A can be a part of or sharing access to the repos to Account A. If you have any follow up questions please LMK",2025-03-21 14:58:46,1,0,0.0,sourcegraph,jdorfman,False,Reddit (r/sourcegraph),https://www.reddit.com/r/sourcegraph/comments/1jgleof/adding_multiple_private_github_repos/mj0t83n/
mj10o03,,"Hmmm... Ok. So you're saying the access needs to be handled on the Github side. So I could add Account A as a contributor to Account B.
