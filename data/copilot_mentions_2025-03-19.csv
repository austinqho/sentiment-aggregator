when it comes to these files that contain these words(my combat system), it just pops a filtering error and stops working.

Anyways, as for your issue, the way I dealt with it when I used to use copilot was by adding comments or restructuring code around the trigger words that let the AI know that they are related to the task in hand. For example, I was working on a bad word filter and had an array of bad words. As soon as I added ""fuck"" all suggestions stopped working. Renaming the array to ""filterWords"" solved the issue. So you could for example, restructure your code to let it know that those are attack types. If you do not want to restructure your code, you can try adding comments near the words such as ""// when the player dies"", ""// when the player presses space"", etc. Good luck.",2025-02-17 15:09:22,6,0,0.0,github,zane_erebos,False,Reddit (r/github),https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/1irt1rw/copilot_filtering/mdb1boj/

1it1l3v,"Is a "".copilotignore"" Feature on the Horizon for Individual Users?","I’ve been digging into ways to enhance security while using GitHub Copilot—specifically, a method to prevent it (and Copilot Chat) from reading certain sensitive files (like .env, .config files). I’m aware that GitHub Copilot Business/Enterprise has content exclusion settings that let you specify file paths to ignore. However, as an individual subscriber, I don’t see an equivalent option.

My ideal solution would be something similar to a “.copilotignore” file (or a configuration option within VSCode) that would allow me to disable Copilot’s access to files containing sensitive data.

Now I don't know if I didn't set up 2FA properly or if someone got access to my account and set it up for themseleves (account looks fine, old public repositories ok, no visible activity on my profile) but it sure is enabled and I have essentially no way to log in ever again. 

Whatever, such is the game of 2FA, fine. It's an old student account with almost nothing on it anyway.

However, my subscription is still going. I made a support request (TERRIBLE system when you can't log in by the way) to have it cancelled in late December. No answer a month and a half later, and still being billed.

Now, the next steps available to me are a legal private information deletion request (legal in my country) or getting a whole ass new credit card just for github. Needless to say it would be a massive hassle.

1. Will the agents feature cost extra to regular copilot? Will there be faster and slower requests depending on your subscription? A ballpark figure would be fine
1. Will the agents feature allow selecting different AI models to send questions to?
1. When do you guess this is going to move to stable? Ballpark figure is fine as well, I understand there can be a long road ahead.
1. Why is it called Copilot when under the hood it uses the Claude model? I thought all Copilot branding from Microsoft uses the ChatGPT and other OpenAI models?
1. Are there third party AI assistants you look at for inspiration and what features you saw them implement that you just had to have?
1. Will there be a solution to automatically import dependencies with autocomplete or do you really rely on agents to do that?
1. Will Copilot in the future implement eslint/stylelint/htmlhint and other linters to write the code how you want it?
1. Will copilot be open to third party extensions to implement as AI backend or have them use AI for certain features too or will it be limited to what VSCode and Copilot decide?
1. Will third party extensions get the same API's for VSCode that Copilot is using?

I have had some experience with Cline and Cursor. I love how they can do all kinds of things automatically and think there's a big future to having them do stuff. Still a lot of work to do and fine-tune because at times they still make stuff up, keep circling around the same solution or get confused about the issues to fix. Or that it refuses to look into my constants and interface (files) to see what the object will be like. But I also noticed that its a lot more expensive than what a regular subscription is able to do.

mes4fe3,,"Thanks for interesting questions. Let me answer, but keep in mind that this is my personal point of view as a VS Code product manager.  
1. Right now I am not aware of any no plans to change the cost structure. So agent mode will be available to Free/Pro/Business/Enterprise.

2. It already allows (claude 3.5, 3.7, gpt-4o) - give it a try!

3. I already answered that in this discussion. Rough estimate mid-March

4. This is a more of a marketing / branding question. But just because it is called Copilot does not mean it must only talk to OpenAI models. I do not think we as MS ever made that statement for any of the Copilot products.

5. We already get a large amount of user feedback / feature requests. So as always just listening to our users gives us enough signals to decide what to do next

6. Regular suggestions (non AI ones) can auto import on accept sometimes. It makes sense that GH Copilot supports this. Please file a feature request [https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release) and ping me at isidorn

7. Agent mode already listens on lint / error changes via the getErrors tool and auto-corrects

8. We already have a Chat and Language Model extensibility story [https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release) and [https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model) and we continuously try to expand our API surfaces. So tell us what you would like to see, and share your scenarios!

9. Per each API we decide if we want to finalise it and expose it to all extensions or not. So far we have finalised: completions, chat, language model, shell integration (that Cline extension send kudos to us for doing). Having said that there are still APIs that are proposed and not possible to be used by all 3rd party extensions. Finalising APIs is an investment for our small team, so we carefully decide what we finalise.

1jaah64,GitHub Copilot is Using Outdated Models (2023 Cutoff) – How to Use Newer AI Like ChatGPT-4 & Claude?,"I've been using GitHub Copilot, but I noticed it's running on older AI models with a cutoff date in 2023. Compared to that, I have ChatGPT Plus (GPT-4-turbo) and Claude Sonnet, both of which have a 2024 knowledge cutoff and are significantly better in terms of reasoning, coding, and overall assistance.

I've tried different models within GitHub Copilot (Claude, ChatGPT 4o, o1), and they all produce same result. I want to integrate newer AI models (like GPT-4-turbo or Claude) with GitHub Copilot to get better suggestions.

Has anyone figured out a way to do this? Maybe via custom APIs, plugins, or third-party extensions? Would love to hear your thoughts!

From time to time, my CPU gets stuck at 100% after using Copilot. It’s not just a spike, it’s constant and seems like it could last indefinitely.

In Windows Task Manager, the only app using the CPU is VSCode. Everything goes back to normal when I manually restart the Extension Host Manager. I’m pretty sure it’s related to Copilot because this happens repeatedly after the first prompt.

I reinstalled VSC and cleaned his cache in the APP\_DATA folder. I also recently changed my CPU and motherboard, but the issue persists.

Really have a pain to use VS Code, switch to Nvim to investigate the codebase and back to VS - but Cursor work too good for my coding needs and improves my workflow dramatically, i wasn't possible to build so huge updates on large projects and cover them with tests. I stopped to hate my colleagues for code review comments and happy to implement requested updates and tests )) Cursor pricing is quite worse then Copilot and you're limited with 500 credits per month.

The worse experience been with Windsurf - totally unexpected for me as i'm a big fan of their Codeium free autocomplete extension and using it for years, it's very good! But the pricing model of Windsurf is far too greedy, they charge a credit for each message you send to Sonnet and it differs a lot from Cursor a lot, i just got scared how quick my 5 test credits were spent on Windsurf. Cursor eats your money far slower. 

So for now Cursor functionality and pricing is a winner combo for me, but as soon as Copilot will update extension bit more and get closer to Cursor - i'll switch for Copilot as i don't like the idea of limited credits, and 500 monthly limit wasn't enough for my needs.",2025-02-21 02:42:58,2,0,0.0,vscode,cyberloh,False,Reddit (r/vscode),https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/1ita366/why_do_people_switch_to_cursor/mdycao6/

miihdpd,,"* Cline (with Openrouter) as chat assistant - Copilot as backup
* Tabnine or Cody as autocomplete
* Claude 3.7 as LLM

I find copilot to be too slow to provide autocomplete. With Cody you can just keep pressing tab and it will continue writing stuff that is useful. Tabnine isn't too far off. Both have unlimited completions for a fixed monthly fee. Copilot is going to get better but overall is still very slow. Both in chat responses and in autocomplete. If they fix that, I would return. Cline is very useful in its automation, much like Cursor. I find Cursor to be more expensive vs Cline and I don't need to setup a new IDE (the migration doesn't work well for me, it automatically enables plugins I have disabled but installed and doesn't seem to pick up all my VSCode settings all too well. And Cline basically does the same thing. I have it set up with Claude 3.7 through Openrouter and its fine.

Overall with chat I notice that too often it still comes back to the same solutions that don't work. It also often provides outdated suggestions for API's that are already changed or renamed. And even though I have a lot of stuff in my context that I always use, it still frequently ignores stuff and uses more common code style and stuff that I just dislike for it being very basic and not very standardized (like not having any ESLint/Prettier/Stylistic improvements). For testing it frequently suggests using stuff from a different library and it hardly ever looks at my enums, constants and interfaces to see what the value might look like.

Autocomplete works best if you provide a comment on what you want to autocomplete.

Like, if you give it a comment like `// here is a list of cars with red, blue, green and yellow paint` it will immediately suggest `paint: ""red""` as the first one and so on. Which is why I now have a lot more comments in my code as it just helps with generation (though I still remove plenty when I'm done). I also often ask it to provide proof or links to documentation first before I accept his suggestions so I know it doesn't just make shit up.

Overall Claude seems the most useful right now and for what I write it will likely be that for some time. My stack is Typescript, Angular, Vitest, Playwright with BDD, Storybook and Tailwind. It took some time to write a context that it seems to use the most but sometimes its still like I'm arguing with a small child when I want it to do stuff.

If you’re jumping into AI coding assistants for VSCode in 2025, here’s the rundown:

GitHub Copilot is still the default choice, now with support for multiple AI models (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.).

Tabnine is decent if you want AI completions but care about privacy (local and cloud models available).

Cursor is actually a VSCode fork, not just an extension. It’s basically VSCode but with AI baked into the editor itself—code generation, refactoring, explanations, etc. If you want AI fully integrated rather than just a plugin, it’s worth checking out.


If you’re already used to VSCode, Copilot is probably the easiest to start with, but Cursor is an interesting option if you want AI at every level.

1ix2xm9,vscode-vim-mode: A Gentle Path to Vim Bliss in VS Code,">***TL;DR***

>\- This is a plugin promotion. Feel free to skip if you're not interested. I developed this tool to address specific workflow needs and hope it benefits others too.

>\- Transforms VS Code into a GVim  by running Vim within its integrated terminal

>\- Preserves editing states between sessions, sync file save actions between VSCode and Vim/Neovim

>\- Only suitable for hardcore Vim users, you need to have a meticulously configured Vim environment already in place

>\- Untested on Windows, it should work with WSL

🌟 **Hello Vim Enthusiasts!** 🌟

As a fellow Vim lover, I’ve built **vscode-vim-mode** to gently bridge Vim’s efficiency with VS Code’s modern features. If you’re curious about blending these worlds, I’d be honored if you gave it a try.

👉 **What it offers**:

* **Lightweight Vim/Neovim integration** without disrupting your VS Code workflow (Copilot, extensions, etc).
* **Peaceful coexistence**: Runs alongside plugins like VSCodeVim or VSCodeNeovim.
* **Simple toggle**: Switch modes with a button or command—no complexity.
* **Optional save sync**: For Neovim users, quietly trigger formatting on save.

This is a small attempt to serve the Vim community. If it makes even one coder’s day smoother, I’ll consider it worthwhile.

📦 **If you’d like to explore**:

* [Install via VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wy-z.vscode-vim-mode)
* [View or contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/wy-z/vscode-vim-mode)

**Thank you** for your time—and if you run into any issues or have suggestions, please feel free to reach out. Your feedback would mean a lot!

*Happy coding, and may your keystrokes stay efficient!* 🚀

1j21z4c,Vscode on Mobile?,"Hey everyone,

I've been using VS Code and GitHub Copilot Agent, and it's really streamlined my coding process. It's almost like coding has turned into just writing prompts instead of actual code. I always double-check everything, but it’s definitely made things faster.

So, I was wondering, are there any mobile based tools for this? If programming is shifting towards prompt-based, why not do it on mobile too? It'd be great to code on the go and speed up progress even more. Any thoughts or suggestions?

Thanks!

1ivur7j,"VSCode reverted files back to a state several days ago, weeks progress lost.","I opened up VSCode, booted up the docker containers in WSL as I've done for the last couple weeks, only to dicover that my Dockerfile and docker-compose have been reverted to a state they were perhaps a week ago. I've been developing in these files locally for a time now and it was fine just hours ago but now, no.

I don't know what to say, I've lost weeks of work now and I can't rule out other files haven't been ruined either. There is no editing history in the files and these particular files weren't git tracked yet so I can't even save them from that.. VSCode never again

Adding some context, I've noticed that Copilot has issues with file contents and history, where it keeps referring to old code that does not exist anymore. Today is the first time I used copilot for a week or two, so I guess activating Copilot now again made vscode somehow revert my files to the state they were in last I used it.

Yes, I should have properly tracked all my files, I didn't exactly predict this would happen..",2025-02-22 17:21:46,0,5,0.2,vscode,Natural_Abies_6250,True,Reddit (r/vscode),https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/1ivur7j/vscode_reverted_files_back_to_a_state_several/

1ixl5p5,Mermaid Diagrams from code,"I made a thingy over the weekend that I thought y'all might like. It's an extension to generate mermaid diagrams from code. It uses an LLM to generate the diagram and renders it in a side window in VS-code. 

I had something like this running on the side to better understand copilot generated code and figured I might as well turn it into an integration. 

For now it uses just Sambanova for the LLM (super fast, plus free trial available ). But it would be easy enough to extend it with other LLMs. Its bring your own API key only. 

I am also working on V2 that can scan the whole code base and create diagrams of how everything connects.

And when I first saw these tools I was really excited to use these tools because in my previous attempt at learning programming, one of the main reasons why I stopped was because writing syntax for logic I knew how to build just tired me out. 

But when I started using github copilot, it didn't really seem like ""cheating"" To me because I view programming as more of building logic rather than learning syntax. 
But still, I am pretty new to programming, so I would be open to new opinions on this matter.

mffmagh,,"I've met a lot of those teachers - they seem to think that programming (any kind of programming, be it HTML, XML, CSS, JSON, or Java, C, Python, JavaScript) is about learning keywords and syntax, and automagically being able to organize and structure code while learning the semantics and logic at the same time.

I used to have the same idea, until I noticed that what students learning with notepad was struggling with, was syntax, forgetting semicolons or brackets, or closing tags, where as what students learning with actual modern editors was struggling with, was understanding how to most effectively solve the problems given in the assignments.

What finally convinced me of the stupidity of the ""better learn it the simple way first"" was when I had a class that was taught with all the fancy plugins, getting rainbow-colored bracket-matching, automatic indentation, automatic tag-closing, automatic formatting and automatic highlighting of compile and validation errors, as well as syntax highlighting. After their first semester another class started with one of the notepad-teachers, and some of the students that had been learning with all the modern tools were employed as teaching assistants. They could easily spot errors in syntax (indentation, missing closing etc.) in the notepad-students' work, and help them fix it - even though they didn't have all the fancy tools at their disposal. And they soon realized that these poor students weren't learning programming, but were learning how to structure and format code correctly - and the new students never reached the same level as the ones with the fancy tools.

The only tool I'm still not too thrilled about is the fully automatic line-completion in JetBrains editors - as well as of course using CoPilot or other tools to actually write the code. But anything that can help you structure the code and avoid writing syntax errors - I'd recommend it.

But of course the notepad teachers are still going strong - and every improvement to new editors is used as an argument against teaching the students to use those tools.

They DO help with learning to program - and then you can always write code (and pseudocode) on paper when you have learned how to program!",2025-03-01 09:17:54,52,0,0.0,learnprogramming,peterlinddk,False,Reddit (r/learnprogramming),https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j0z67j/html_teacher_wants_us_to_use_notepad_instead_of/mffmagh/
mffrnk3,,"As someone who's taught coders before, I think there's some validity to the ""struggle"" idea, but largely disagree with it.

One actually valid concern for new programmers is that there's a very fine line between tools making your life easier and more difficult, and the more IDE you start with at the beginning, the more you tend to live in the ""difficult"" space. Complex tools have complex usage and configuration patterns, and you don't want to spend all your time just making your environment work.

I do agree about avoiding AI, but there are lots of other tools like interactive syntax highlighting and autocompletion that have been around for decades, and do reduce your cognitive load by A LOT. Plus some of the handy plugins for doing quick builds or loads or whatnot, those can be huge frustration avoiders.

I'm a little out of the loop since I don't code for a day job anymore. Is Copilot automatically integrated and if so can you avoid it by removing plugins or using VSCodium or things like that?

So I explained to the teacher that I was already employed for over a year and doing this is a real world setting, that no one is using Dreamweaver professionally, that the senior team I brought my assignments to were laughing at them.


After class I was asked to stay behind, HE wanted to lecture me about embarrassing him. I showed him my job offer, salary and a couple of projects. then went to faculty management explaining what had happened.


To cut this off short, he was replaced immediately, and I got full credit for the paper using a work project that was already complete.

2. With a decent portfolio showcasing *your* skills (not through copying tutorial projects) you can definitely become employable, even in today's market.
3. ""I’m using GitHub Copilot"" - stop it if you *really* want to *learn* and *improve*. Don't let it do *your* work, *your* thinking, *your* programming. Yes, writing boilerplate is boring, but you absolutely need to learn to do it on your own. You are effectively outsourcing. With your approach, you will even less prevail in the age of AI than if you completely ignored it and actually *learned* to become *self sustaining*.

mg6kmdk,,"Following that roadmap will not make you an intermediate developer. It *might* get you to junior level, depending on how diligent you are.

Assume 2000-4000 hours worth of study and practice to get to maybe being hirable as a junior, and 5000 hours worth of professional experience after that to be intermediate. Expect to take 4-5 years to become hirable as a junior (that's about how long a B.Sc. in CS will take you, plus maybe an internship), and another 3-5 years of working full time as a programmer beyond that to hit intermediate.

>I’m using GitHub Copilot, and it feels like it does a lot of the work for me. Do I really need to go through all of this learning when AI is advancing so quickly?

So, a lot of people talk about AI eliminating junior roles and I don't know how true that actually is or not. But it definitely won't eliminate more senior roles who'll be needed to fix all the mistakes the AI makes. So you need developers who are *significantly more skilled and knowledgeable* than the AI is - if you can't do everything the AI does with trivial effort on your part, how can you then go an know more than the AI does?

Ways in which this affects me:
- Writing design docs bores me. I would rather prototype and learn as I do. Though I do see benefit of designing to ensure requirements are clear, evaluate trade-offs, and prevent wasted efforts / inefficient solutions. I see the benefit. I just don’t enjoy writing them as much. I like to do. 
- It’s difficult for me to estimate the ETA of a task. I’d rather just work on two important tasks in parallel and try to finish both as quickly as possible. When I am blocked on one, I work on the other. 
- And I’m worried that Cursor/Copilot AI is going to automate me, and I don’t really have any career plan here when that happens.

So far I always ace the initial leetcode interviews, system design questions and behavioural questions, but the moment I hit practical questions, my brain shuts off and and works at a snails pace. I've gotten really good at communicating my thoughts with the design for how to solve the problem, but coding the solution is very slow for me, where I backtrack to use better data structures. It doesn't come easy, and I only seem to know what to do as I code, and by the time I have a better idea of how to code it's too late, it's the end of the interview, and the interviewer is looking at me like I'm a fraud.

Just looking to see where I can find more practical interview questions for me to practice. Copilot is unable to generate these for me, it just generates the same ones or points me towards leetcode questions.

Please drop down any resources below, I'd really appreciate it. Been out of a job for more than half a year now and my wallet is not too happy :'(

I’m a mid-level full-stack engineer with **3 years of experience**, mainly working with **React, Node.js, and AWS**, and I’m currently looking for my next role in **London**. The interview process has been a bit of a rollercoaster—every company seems to have a completely different approach, and I’m struggling to figure out how to prepare efficiently.

So far, I’ve come across:

* **LeetCode-style DS&A questions** (fairly standard, but still hit-or-miss on difficulty)
* **Verbal technical deep dives** (these range from broad discussions to very specific knowledge checks)
* **Pair programming sessions** (this is where I feel the least prepared)

I find that because the formats vary so much, I don’t know where to focus my time. Has anyone else dealt with this? What’s the best way to prep, especially for **pair programming**? I also find it harder and more daunting because I feel like I’ve become reliant on Copilot, and writing code from my own head seems much harder now.

I currently use Copilot because Cursor feels like it tries to replace too much of how I actually USE my IDE in the first place. Not to toot my own horn but hey, I've been coding since I was 14 and I'm 49. Imagine knowing a foreign language for almost 40 years. You may not be the best in the world at it but you've still outgrown tools like Duolingo.

I don't ""chat"" with Copilot and ask it to write a function for me. It's not even about the code it generates. It just honestly takes me longer to write the prompts in the precise way needed to get the function done the way I would have just written it myself. I work mostly on business-oriented Web and mobile apps, and usually when their logic gets complex it's because there are more rules, not because you're trying to come up with a yet-more-optimal ed25519 curve generator. Time sheets can't be submitted if they don't have start and end times. Oh, also, they can't be submitted if the job code is inactive. Oh, and don't forget, end time must be > start time. Oh and a shift can't be >20h without human approval. Oh yeah, check to be sure it's not a holiday. You get the idea. Just listing all that in a chat session as precisely as you need to do to get the code to be correct - I could have just written it in a few minutes. I didn't need help with that.

The reason I use it at all is because of REFACTORING. Man, Copilot is insanely useful when it comes to that. Pivoting some nested object of consts into an array to feed something like a form-fields-defaults dropdown... I'll get some spreadsheet from Product, paste it into a comment, then just start typing the first entry of the array in the shape I want them all to be. By the time I'm on the second or third, it's figured out what I'm doing and I can just code-complete to get the rest.

1it3dhk,[Partially Rant] I truly want to use AI but..,"Hello everyone. I'm actually using ChatGPT and Copilot to help me in my daily job. Since now I just used those to help me write basic functions as some sort of personal assistant. Stuff like ""provide a function that sorts my array of objects given that specific logic"" or ""provide a boilerplate for that framework using that other framework"". This because I never managed to get something more usefull from an LLM. 

Cause people keep saying I'm the one who uses them bad I've spent the last 4 months trying to leverage LLM power to a further level...failing miserably. 

As a test project I'm now trying to convert a 3d engine I've already wrote in C++ to a webgl2 engine using typescript. I decided to use ChatGPT o1 and o3 since the beginning of the project hoping that the LLM could keep its own context updated by not needing to interpret some already existing sources. ChatGPT was able to provide a typescript project with the Hello World of 3d programming:  a working WebGL2  example with a static triangle. Nice! 

  
At this point problems arise.  As the project grew and modularity kicked in ChatGPT started allucinating badly. As every decent 3d engine works I split my Classes into modules. So now I have a Renderer class, a Scene class, a Mesh class, some Utility classes like CompileShaders, LoadTextures and so on. 

  
No matter how hard I try and how frequently I reupload my sources, ChatGPT keeps ""forgetting"" stuff he has provided and keeps writing (buggy) new code as the previous work never existed. I need a new shader? ChatGPT keeps writing private functions to load and compile shaders, even if I just reminded it he already provided a Utility class that specifically does that.  A texture? Let's rewrite the texture loading code instead of using the already existing one that ChatGPT itself provided. 

And BLODY HELL, I hate when it does an error and I need to keep telling it to not include that error. ""Hey that part is wrong, you should do it that way"" ""Ok"" And then, after one step, it keeps doing the same error I told it not to do.

I tried updating the context by explaining stuff, by re-uploading to ChatGPT the current sources, using single files, using an archive of the whole folder. Nothing works. It seems it can ""remember"" stuff it did for 1 or 2 steps then it restarts from scratch.

is it me? Is it the model I'm using? Is it a context capacity issue? Are we still far from a truly usable LLM to do real world stuff other than ""write me this simple code I can write by myself but I'm too lazy to type""?",2025-02-19 06:31:34,0,21,0.41,webdev,rio_sk,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1it3dhk/partially_rant_i_truly_want_to_use_ai_but/
mdmhmyj,,"In the current state of LLM using them efficiently to tackle real coding uses is a skill, let's be honest most people that coded before the LLM era suck big time at it, like big BIG time, even better they don't want to learn, they expect LLM to meet them in their comfort zone.

Learning to Google is a skill, if you can't do it, it's quite obvious to someone that knows how to do it. It's a skill because knowing the boundaries and hitting the right spot at the boundary is what makes you good at it, people that can't do that have a very hard time finding whatever they are looking for with Google. You don't randomly type your whole codebase on google and expect a solution to appear ...

I've been using things that existed before Copilot and GPT3.0 (those were BAD) and I mastered the use of the tool, each new updates I could appreciate the new capabilities and could see boundaries expanding.

LLM are limited, forget stuff, make mistakes, hallucinate stuffs etc... each one of them have their own strength and limits, currently they are weak enough that it's not only noticeable but differences between models and providers are also clearly noticeable.

I've been coding for about 20 years, and I took me a bit of time to fully embrace the new meta but once I started to master it, it's became easier than Googling stuffs, it's 100x more powerful than any other tool we had in the past, be it builtin docs or search engines/ SO etc...

Everytime I see a senior dev trying to use a LLM, he looks like a child about to hit his head on a table that he isn't seeing, it's obvious before he even start writing his message that it's not going to work the whole premise and the way he's approaching the problem is incorrect, he then writes something that makes it even more obvious that he doesn't understand what he's doing, the expected failure inevitably comes.",2025-02-19 10:09:34,1,0,0.0,webdev,SaltMaker23,False,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1it3dhk/partially_rant_i_truly_want_to_use_ai_but/mdmhmyj/

mi0qgdk,,"hahaha why are you so sore ? I've started using LLMs 3 months ago. I became a software engineer without the use of AI. I didn't want to use LLMs at first because I thought I would stop getting better as an engineer, that I would use it instead of coming up with solutions. I was wrong. It's just a tool like any other.

I actually don't use copilot, for example, exactly because I want to stay sharp and write my own code, knowing exactly what I do and why I do it.

All I use AI for is to aggregate information. I do a lot of R&D, and if I have to try 10 different packages and find out which is best for my use case, I save a lot of time by prompting an LLM to aggregate basic information and get a base implementation, instead of going through pages of forums and docs. Then when I find the right one, guess what, I still go the ""old"" route of doing the job myself, researching, implementing.

You have a specific question about a specific package ? You could spend hours going through forums, stack overflow posts, or you could prompt an LLM to do it for you. I don't see how that makes me a worse programmer. I still verify my findings with trusted sources.

You say you understand it but your first comment crearly showed you didn't, so at this point I don't know why you're talking. You're giving your opinion (that nobody asked for, by the way), on something you don't understand.

1j8d7rx,Upgrading Old PHP Website (PHP 5 → PHP 8.x) Using AI - Need Guidance,"Hey!

I’m currently upgrading an old PHP 5 website to the latest PHP version. I have all original files (public_html), including PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various include files. The website’s structure and appearance need to remain exactly the same—only backend code (mostly PHP) needs upgrading for compatibility and security.

I’ve used AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude extensively, but it’s becoming cumbersome due to context window limitations. Each new chat loses context about my project.

My Ideal Scenario:
	•	Upload the entire public_html folder somewhere (like GitHub).
	•	Have an AI (GitHub Copilot or something similar) analyze the entire folder, understand interdependencies among files, and help me update outdated PHP code seamlessly.
	•	Continuously test and ensure the website remains functional at every step.

I’ve heard good things about GitHub Copilot with Claude 3.7 Sonnet integration and Codespaces, but I’m not experienced enough to fully understand if this meets my needs. Can anyone experienced in upgrading legacy PHP sites using AI tools guide me?

Key Questions:
	•	Is GitHub Copilot Pro good enough to handle a full website upgrade from PHP 5 to latest versions?
	•	Can it maintain context across multiple files effectively?
	•	How do you practically test database connections and functionality within this AI-assisted workflow?
	•	Any pitfalls or better approaches?

Thanks in advance for any guidance!

1j6d84j,Best AI for Programming (2025-03),"Hey all, I've been using free-tier AI tools pretty intensively over the past few months to support my work and daily life. About 70% of my usage is for programming, and the rest is for other stuff. I’ve been jumping between tools like ChatGPT, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Deepseek—mostly because one of them is usually down or hits its limit when I need it.

Recently, I discovered Lovable dev (along with similar options like Bolt and v0) and gave it a try—pretty impressive stuff 😅. Now I'm feeling a bit stuck on which one is really worth upgrading to a paid subscription.

Any thoughts or suggestions? Also, if anyone’s got a setup that mixes two or more free AIs or even self-hosting options (whether on your own hardware or a rented server), I'm all ears.

1j0bvk2,AI Code Assistant Demos,"I think tools like Cursor and Copilot are nice. They haven’t been useful or reliable enough to revolutionize my workflow, but they certainly keep me from bouncing around Stack Overflow.

I just find the messaging around these tools to be a little bizarre. There is almost a late night infomercial vibe to it all. 

“Throw all your knives away! You only need this one!”

I saw a post by someone who works at a VP level raving over a demo where someone cloned an app using some AI tool. He then trash talked the “old school” way of building software with scrum teams and dozens of devs.

It was very disappointing, and alarming to see a post like that, because I feel he should know better. Imagine working as a welder, and your boss walks in and says, “I saw a commercial where this guy put an entire boat together using this stuff called Flex Seal. All he had to do was spray it on. I want all this old school welding equipment out of here.”

I wish the messaging around these tools would change. Because they are good tools, and they deserve better than “For only $19.99, you can build an app in minutes!”
