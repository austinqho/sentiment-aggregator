You can checkout some of these models, they still exist if you use the API. The current SOTA models from GOOGLE are not as good as some of these.

1j33szx,Google AI Introduces PlanGEN: A Multi-Agent AI Framework Designed to Enhance Planning and Reasoning in LLMs through Constraint-Guided Iterative Verification and Adaptive Algorithm Selection,">*Google AI introduces PlanGEN—a multi-agent framework designed to improve planning and reasoning in large language models by incorporating constraint-guided iterative verification and adaptive algorithm selection. PlanGEN comprises three agents that work in concert: the constraint agent extracts problem-specific details, the verification agent evaluates the quality of the proposed plan, and the selection agent chooses the most appropriate inference algorithm based on the problem’s complexity. Rather than relying on a single, rigid approach, this framework facilitates a process in which initial plans are refined iteratively, ensuring that the final output is both accurate and contextually appropriate.*

>*PlanGEN represents a thoughtful advance in addressing the challenges inherent in complex planning and reasoning for large language models. By combining the strengths of multiple specialized agents, the framework supports a more deliberate and iterative approach to generating high-quality plans.
