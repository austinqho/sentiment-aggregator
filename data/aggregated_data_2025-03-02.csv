I have a docs folder, windsurf memory populated with significant info about the project etc. However, the best thing that worked for me was the static tooling like prettier and ES lint. If i request a feature or a bug fix, Cascade will inevitably look for the files and information that is need within the actual codebase. I have been developing my app for quite some time without any problems, iterating, improving and i ""feel"" that if you are good with prompting, Cascade will get everything it needs by itself within the codebase. It is an experiment, one that proves to work time and time again, so the conclusion is if it works for you it will work even better while they improve their tooling and LLMs get more intuitive about your intent as 3.7 proves to be. hope this helps.",2025-03-02 04:10:00,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j1p0ki/ive_been_using_windsurf_completely_stock_no/mflczhs/,Positive,0.9928,u/SkypeLee,"{""score"": 3, ""num_comments"": 0, ""upvote_ratio"": 0.0, ""is_post"": false}","[""windsurf""]"
1j1pcsz,"Biggest issue in Windsurf

TLDR: The cascade apply changes pannel reappearing on Undo/Redo operations, deleting work progress

I've been loving Windsurf since the beginning. A regular user. But this is the biggest issue that keeps bothering me. And it's a serious software issue rather than AI related.

If you add some changes using cascade, and approve the changes. Then work on the file, and for some need do an Undo, If your undo passes when the cascade change got applied, it messes everything up. The apply change pannel pops up. And if you try to redo to get back to where you were, your undo redo history is wipped.

And what is far worse, the apply change pannel appears on all other files that were affected by the cascade change. You don't even know what to do, as you cant even have ""Accept all"" button. You won't know which changes are legit, whether to accept or reject, which one keeps your work progress in undo/redo history...

It is like a messy trip wire that messes everything up if you pass the undo level on any of the changed files.

I have been having this issue for sometime, and thought ""I might have to learn how to predict its behaviour and mange this"". That was until today, after i made changes affecting more than 27 files with consecutive prompts, ready to git commit, and when i was manually adjusting some things in a small affected file, when doing some undo, it suddenly passed the cascade change applied undo/redo history, and the cascade apply changes pannel appeared on all the recently affected files, I was shocked as i didn't commit, tried to do redo to get back to where I was. It had deleted all my redo history, all changes i wrote were gone. Even worse, I don't know which files got affected by the apply request. beyond what i can track based on their dependency. After carefully trying to understand, approve changes. It was completely unpredictable, even erasing full file changes for newly generated files. No undo/redo. Files directly changed at disk. I gave up and decided to come write this after losing long hours this way. Reminds me of the pain you fill when you accidentally do a git reset with --hard

The worst part, when you do an Undo, it doesn't affect the file being edited, it rather makes changes on disk.

Has anyone else encountered this issue with redo/undo on Windsurf?",2025-03-02 04:02:48,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j1pcsz/biggest_issue_in_windsurf/,Negative,-0.9817,u/Powishiswilfre,"{""score"": 3, ""num_comments"": 3, ""upvote_ratio"": 1.0, ""is_post"": true}","[""windsurf""]"
1j1p574,"A bug or? I'm not really sure.

I'm working with windsurf this morning and my code happens to be related to model training. I'm getting output messages I haven't seen before and it seems unable to write code to file despite numerous attempts. And it looks like I might be seeing some of cascade's system prompt? I'm not really sure what exactly is going on, but it has been kind of interesting to watch the struggle -  But it finally just gave up a minute ago and used the terminal to write the code change. So I'm not really sure if I'm reporting a bug related to this kind of code or what but thought I'd share anyway.

1j156z6,"is it possible to use Windsurf with Cascade on remote servers?

Hi everyone,

I know that there is an option on the homepage for connecting to a remote server, which led me to believe that it would be possible to use this with Cascade.¬†

However, I also imagine that getting Cascade to take direct action on a remote might be complicated.¬†

I was able to authenticate into a server on my home network over SSH. However, I'm not able to use Cascade as it doesn't launch and the discovery of files and folders on the remote server also seems a bit spotty.¬†

I've done direct development on remote servers using VS Code quite a lot, so I know that it's definitely possible, but I haven't done any AI-assisted development in this type of setup yet.¬†

Thanks in advance for any clarifications!

1j11s0e,"Cascade :: Sonnet 3.7 Timing Out ‚Äì Anyone Else Facing This?

Sonnet 3.7 was working fine for me about three days ago, but now it keeps timing out. I‚Äôve tried different accounts, including Windsurf and Windsurf Next. It runs for a few minutes and then starts throwing the same errors again. Other models aren't generating usable code, either.

I even restarted Cascade and deleted the `.windsurf` folder to reset the context and memory, but no luck.

Is anyone else experiencing this? Any known workarounds?

Also, Cursor Free is intermittently failing on Sonnet 3.7, so I‚Äôm not sure if this is an Anthropic-related issue. Either way, nothing seems to be working now.

I would appreciate any insights!

I believe I saw somewhere that if we provide a sufficiently detailed specification, Windsurf is potentially capable of generating a complete project. However, I find this somewhat difficult to believe.

What are the limitations (number of files, file size, credit cost, etc.)?
How reliable is it?

I'm not a developer and would like to test this kind of process to see what results it produces.

Use git as your life depends on it, because with Windsurf it does!

So basically it goes like this:

You sneezed?

git add -A  
git commit -m ""Working on something using Windsurf, God help me! :( the AIs are soo bad....""

Then you add a button successfully?  
  
git add -A  
git commit -m ""Just added a button using Windsurf, God help me! :( the AIs are soo bad....""

Then you want to change the text of the button?

After the Windsurf does its magic....

git log --all --graph --decorate

Then you retrieve the latest ""good"" commit:

Windsurf doesn't let the AI access files in .gitignore such as node\_modules.

Though this could be good, it has big issue when working with non famous packages or libraries, as it won't allow the AI to read and understand a package from node\_modules. And accessing library in node\_modules makes a big difference for the AI for not well known and non documented libraries.

I am tired of enabling/ disabling items whenever i ask the AI to do something using such packages.

1izmy9b,"Speech to text for Windsurf + Linux. Any options?

If not, I'm thinking about trying to get Windsurf to create one although as I have zero prior experience in VS Code extension development I'm not too optimistic about my chances.

In ""regular"" VS Code, there's some built in speech-to-text stuff that doesn't provide too much info about what it's actually using, but AFAIK it's server-side/cloud STT (ie, it's not doing STT via a local Whisper instance, etc)

https://preview.redd.it/55c0icpv6qle1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4e162e7c93276c8e3bd91217b217ab19a113ec6

It's not *amazing* (hence I'm fairly sure that it's not any variant of Whisper under the hood). But it is accurate enough that I can create a ""development prompt"" by opening up a markdown doc and just dictating into it. Which I've come to find highly effective.

Sadly, the Whisper landscape on Linux is a little less evolved and tools for real time STT into any text field are fairly scant.

If it helps to elucidate the use-case:

I've never used speech-to-text for actual development, although I know that that's a popular thing to do and there are separate plugins that try to provide a bridge between natural language and coding languages.

Rather, I just find it a very effective way of speeding up the process of writing things like development prompts, debugging instructions, feature edits, and other text documents that I use as a shorthand for providing instructions in an easier way than trying to cram everything into the text box.¬†

Once I have my prompt typed I then just type something like ""try to start creating the app I've outlined in /outline.md"" and ... it works really well! Cascade quickly reads the markdown doc as context, takes it as its instruction, and gets to work. 

Hence, pretty much any STT plugin that lets you go voice -> text would be helpful.

If anyone knows of anything please LMK!",2025-02-27 10:37:32,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1izmy9b/speech_to_text_for_windsurf_linux_any_options/,Positive,0.9928,u/danielrosehill,"{""score"": 1, ""num_comments"": 1, ""upvote_ratio"": 1.0, ""is_post"": true}","[""windsurf""]"

I have a ""notes.md"" where I jot down notes and todo items for my project. I am plagued by nonsense autocomplete suggestions which are at best annoying, and often appear right before I hit ""tab"" to indent and then get accepted.

There is a toggle in Windsurf settings, but it seemed like it took some time to take effect, and it wouldn't re-able properly without reloading the window.

1izkbvr,"Windsurf Question to Codeium team

Hello guys,

i have a question for my understanding:

I just want to do prompt base coding. I create US / Project file md with external LLM such as ChatGPT or Claude3.7. Then i get some text files like the US file or the general project file out of it. Those file i add to my project folder and mention it.

Now with Claud 3.7 in Windsurf i want to execute the US one after another. 

But all the time there is only Analyze file after file. 200 lines at a time.

As i do not code by hand and do not edit any file, why is the analyse step even nessecarry? Shouldnt Windsurf know all the state of teh file and use thew right context straight ways? 

Or how can i do this better?

An idea would be to create my own MCP Service here where i can store the whole context locally and integratoe gpt and claude there as input givers to create my context and then use Windsurf only to fetch from there to skip those steps of analyze all teh stuuf again and again?

  
The test i do is with a simple task where i want to make a showcase texas hold em single player with some GTO output to have a little more complex use case tan just tetris.

  
And btw 

 Status:¬†Invalid0¬†credits¬†used

ErrorCascade has encountered an internal error in this step.

No credits consumed on this tool call.

Can you please give me some advise how to improve that and get faster to the desired results?

mf35djh,"I am not a coder, but have managed software teams before - so I think I have a good understanding of how software is written.

I am finding that using Windsurf has been a good way for me to learn Python and Flask.  As Claude 3.7 makes mistakes over and over and goes down random paths - I am learning more about what concepts like import, trigger and blueprints are.  I am actually then having long conversations with Grok Voice or ChatGPT voice when I don't understand a concept - which ends up being a good learning/tutorial experience.

What I think I am coming to is that the context window of each chat session is limited and when it starts filling up, Claude starts making more mistakes or taking paths it may hallucinate and adding stuff that does not add value.

So I have begun using something I call 'seed prompts',  they are getting long now and probably consuming too much of the context window but it helps keep Claude more in line with the goals and recent history.  Not sure if this is a good idea or not - but it seems to help.  I then ask Claude to write the next seed prompt when the context window is over 70% full (something that should be in the Windsurf UI) and use that seed prompt on the next chat session.

Here is an example of a recent seed prompt I used, I have Claude write me a new one based on the one the chat session started with and to add the recent work done in that session:

    # The Juggler Personal CRM Development Seed Prompt
    
    ## Project Context
    I'm working on ""The Juggler Personal CRM"", a Flask-based web application for managing personal contacts and relationships. The application uses:
    - Python 3.11
    - Flask framework
    - SQLAlchemy for database operations
    - Flask-Login for authentication & Social Logins with Google and Microsoft
    - OAuth integration for Google and Microsoft login
    - Gunicorn as the WSGI server (running on port 5015)
    
    ## Recent Progress
    We've been debugging and fixing issues with the OAuth administration section:
    
    1. Fixed CSRF token handling in templates:
       - Templates were incorrectly using `csrf_token()` as a function call
       - Changed to `{{ csrf_token }}` (without parentheses) in multiple templates
       - This ensures forms submit properly with valid CSRF tokens
    
    2. Fixed OAuth debug JSON API:
       - Modified the debug_oauth route to return JSON when requested via AJAX
       - Added detection for AJAX requests using X-Requested-With header
       - This resolved the ""Error loading configuration data"" issue on test pages
    
    ## Current Status
    - The debug version of the OAuth admin page is now loading correctly
    - We have not yet verified if the original OAuth admin page is functioning properly
    - Debug pages are working and will be kept until we fully solve the main login page
    - We plan to eventually consolidate debug pages into a health/monitoring section
    - Still need to test and ensure all buttons on the OAuth admin page work correctly
    - Need to verify the complete login/logout flow with the main login page
    
    ## Critical Challenge
    We've encountered a persistent issue where fixing one component (OAuth admin or login page) breaks the other. This cycle has repeated approximately 10 times, consuming significant development time. Our primary goal is to break this cycle by:
    - Implementing changes that maintain compatibility between both components
    - Testing thoroughly before and after each change
    - Documenting dependencies between the components
    - Creating a comprehensive test plan that covers both areas simultaneously
    
    ## Development Best Practices
    1. **Gunicorn Restart Management**:
       - Let Gunicorn handle Flask restarts with the `--reload` flag
       - Only manually restart Gunicorn when changing its configuration or port
       - This reduces Windsurf Flow Credits consumption
    
    2. **Testing Approaches**:
       - Browser-based testing is more reliable than curl commands
       - Curl commands sometimes froze or returned misleading results
       - When testing APIs, use the browser's developer tools or dedicated API clients
       - This approach limits Flow Action consumption and provides more accurate results
    
    3. **Code Organization**:
       - Keep route names consistent across the application
       - Use blueprint prefixes consistently in templates
       - Maintain proper error handling, especially for AJAX requests
       - Keep files under 100 lines of code where possible by refactoring into smaller, focused modules
       - Use helper functions and classes to maintain clean, readable code
    
    ## Next Steps
    1. Verify that the original OAuth admin page is functioning properly
    2. Test all buttons on both the debug and original OAuth admin pages while ensuring login page functionality remains intact
    3. Create a comprehensive test plan that covers both OAuth admin and login functionality
    4. Ensure OAuth provider configuration works end-to-end
    5. Verify complete login/logout flow with OAuth providers
    6. Consider consolidating debug tools into a dedicated health/monitoring section
    
    ## Important Notes
    - Always refer to the application as ""The Juggler Personal CRM"" (full name)
    - The application runs on port 5015 with Gunicorn
    - Debug pages have been valuable for identifying and fixing issues
    - Changes to either the OAuth admin or login pages must be tested against both components",2025-02-27 07:54:25,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1iyi866/any_fellow_nontechnical_windsurfers_here_hows_it/mf35djh/,Positive,0.9974,u/Czaruno,"{""score"": 1, ""num_comments"": 0, ""upvote_ratio"": 0.0, ""is_post"": false}","[""windsurf""]"

meus6ia,"# The Disappointing Claude 3.7 Sonnet

Claude 3.7 Sonnet made a grand entrance, but the much-anticipated Claude 3.7 Sonnet AI IDE turned out to be almost unusable, completely losing the obedient nature of Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

On Windsurf, when dealing with projects containing legacy code, Claude 3.7 Sonnet behaves like it‚Äôs on steroids‚Äîwildly invoking tools for no reason. Take a simple task, for example: I asked it to remove the entire `FROM` clause in JSQLParser‚Äôs `FromItemVisitorAdapter` when encountering a table named `DUAL`. Instead of handling it efficiently, it crazily called tools to read the source code over a dozen times, scanning a bunch of unnecessary content, even rereading the same classes multiple times. It also executed unnecessary Gradle calls and made massive modifications to my unit test code, breaking all test cases. The changes were so extensive that I couldn‚Äôt even track them, so I had no choice but to roll back all the modifications entirely.

Facing the exact same problem, Claude 3.5 Sonnet solved it smoothly with just four tool calls and a single Q&A interaction.

As mentioned in the linked discussion, compared to those so-called ""thinking models"" that just sit there doing nothing, Claude 3.7 is more like a reckless maniac who acts first and thinks later.

Similar issues have reportedly occurred in other IDEs as well.",2025-02-26 00:27:25,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1iy0mnt/claude_37_sonnet_available_now_in_windsurf/meus6ia/,Negative,-0.8781,u/CucumberSufficient38,"{""score"": 3, ""num_comments"": 0, ""upvote_ratio"": 0.0, ""is_post"": false}","[""windsurf""]"

1iyi866,"Any fellow ""non-technical"" Windsurfers here? How's it going?

Windsurf is primarily designed for professional developers, but I as a non-programmer, I have found it to be a dream come true and no longer need to hire or employ developers to do most of my app related client work.

Don't get me wrong, the learning curve has been steep, but I am now able to consistently create apps with very few errors and at speed. It took a lot of trial and error and also rapid adaptations to changes with models etc. 

I feel there are unique challenges we face as non-programmers that force us to come up with our own solutions that are different to what programmers would do. And here I'm referring to serious people who are taking this seriously and not as a hobby, or trying to make a quick buck from AI. 

That got me wondering if there are other non-programmers here who would like to share ideas and best practices and maybe we can come up with some sort of manual of best practices for non-programmers using tools like Windsurf.

Dear Codeium,

I'm a sincere fan of the IDE. I've tried a bunch of AI dev tools and share the sentiment of many that Windsurf seems to get the codebase in a more intuitive way. 

But!

A non-insignificant percentage of developers use and love Linux and among them many on non-Debian distros. 

Here we have two issues:

1) The tarball installation method is fully manual and is a PITA when you push out updates every few days.

More significantly:

The tarball just doesn't seem to be well QA'd. After updating, I can't see/edit my extensions.

I used VS Code and Windsurf in parallel for a while but eventually switched back to VS Code. I rely heavily on plugins for analysis and coding, while Windsurf's features became less relevant for my workflow.

For now, my best option is to use the VS Code plugin. While I do miss Cascade, this setup is the most feasible. Switching to a different C++ plugin isn‚Äôt an option either, as most of our team uses VS Code with Microsoft's plugins. Changing plugins could introduce unpredictable issues in our project.



I tried to switch to the vscode extension store, but was unable to install the plugins due to incompatible windsurf/plugin versions

1ixrvvf,"Testing Workspace Rules / Feedback Request

Hey everyone,  
I've been looking into workspace rules a bit more today to try and improve my outcomes a bit. I've read two posts over on the Cursor forms that seemed helpful and I've done some rule refining today based on some of my experience programming Flutter and using AI extensively the last few months. My current rules are below. I'd love to get some feedback on them and any suggestions/experience anyone else has. If you don't like Windsurf rules or feel like this is a waste, no problem. I find it helpful and there have been times recently where it was explicitly referencing my rules, especially around SOLID principles. I've taken out a couple of project specific things but other than that I'd love to hear what y'all think and see what else y'all are using specifically with Windsurf. (Actually in writing this post I realized I could probably improve by including what crash reporting and payment provider APIs I'm using)

    # Flutter Project Development Rules
    
    ## Overview
    
    This document outlines the core rules and guidelines for developing the Mythic GME mobile and digital applications.
    
    <identity>
    
    - You are an expert Flutter developer who helped write Flutter documentation and create Flutter best practices
    - This TTRPG app is a companion app that assists GMs and players in playing TTRPGS
    - They provide core systems include oracles, dice roller, notes, and lists management
    - Consider features from popular TTRPG books and magazines when suggesting improvements
    </identity>
    
    <technical_stack>
    
    - Built using Flutter 3.29.0+
    - Cross-platform support: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux
    - Architecture pattern: MVVM
    - Database: JSON files (saved games)
    - State management: provider
    - Dependency injection: get_it
    - Storage services: local storage, icloud (Apple only)
    </technical_stack>
    
    <development_principles>
    
    - Always prefer decoupling and separation of concerns
    - Always check service initializer and service provider before suggesting changes
    - Apply SOLID Principles:
      - SRP: Single Responsibility Principle
      - OCP: Open/Closed Principle
      - LSP: Liskov Substitution Principle
      - ISP: Interface Segregation Principle
      - DIP: Dependency Inversion Principle
    </development_principles>
    
    <requirement_validation>
        <analysis>
        - Analyze core functionality requirements
        - Document immediate use cases
        - List essential constraints
        - Identify required validation tests
        </analysis>
    
        <verification>
        - Flag ambiguous requirements
        - Identify speculative features
        - Detect premature optimization attempts
        </verification>
    
        <implementation>
        - Write integration tests first
        - Verify tests fail as expected
        - Implement code to satisfy tests
        - Confirm all tests pass
        </implementation>
    </requirement_validation>
    
    <debugging_process>
    
    - Reflect on 5-7 possible problem sources
    - Distill to 1-2 most likely sources
    - Add logs to validate assumptions
    - Implement single changes at a time
    - Test and review changes
    </debugging_process>
    
    <widget_guidelines>
    
    - Prefer smaller widgets over bigger ones (e.g., DecoratedBox over Container)
    - Create responsive, accessible layouts
    - Avoid fixed sizes that don't respond to screen size or text scaling
    - Utilize Flutter's built-in semantics
    - Do not use or suggest MergeSemantics
    </widget_guidelines>
    
    <platform_considerations>
    
    - Different routes load based on platform type (mobile, tablet, desktop)
    - View is determined by platform
    - Consider platform-specific features and limitations
    </platform_considerations>
    
    ## Note
    
    These rules should be followed for all development work on the Mythic GME applications to ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability of the codebase.

Does anyone have experience with Windsurf as a C++ IDE?



We were considering Windsurf for our company but soon realized that many essential plugins are not available. This lack of support makes it impractical for large-scale C++ projects.



Has anyone faced similar challenges?

If your task is simple enough it will get there probably in one go too.

mebk9js,"It doesn't. Windsurf memories, Cursor rules, they are miles behind memory bank. I've used them all extensively and side by side, Memory-bank trumps the rest. 

Now all that being said, Cursor and Windsurf are both better Agents then Cline. They both run cleaner code in my experience, over time. Faster, less error prone and far cheaper than running Claude via Openrouter. 

But the way cline has the memory bank actively in context most of the time, destroys the other two's context and rules. 

The one other agent I'll throw out there is Augment. While it doesn't have rules or memory bank like the others, its indexing and context is absurdly good. And its free claude. Which isn't nothing.

1iw0qnq,"I feel Windsurf is underrated. It deserves more recognition

Yo, there are a ton of AI agent coding tools out there, and every time they roll out an update, it feels like they completely switch up how they understand projects. 

It‚Äôs like they get way more cautious digging deep into duplicate files and even the small-scale stuff. ü§î

I‚Äôve tried using various tools on different side projects every time they update, and honestly, some of them really disappoint.

But gotta give credit where it‚Äôs due: even though Windsurf is missing a few features and struggles with some LLM models, when it comes to truly understanding my projects especially compared to something like Claude Sonnet it just nails it.

This is purely my two cents, coming from someone who‚Äôs practically tried every AI agent out there with zero bias. Just wanted to toss my opinion into the mix. ü´†
