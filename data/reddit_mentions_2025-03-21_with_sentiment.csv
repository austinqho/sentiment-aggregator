1jgnrh8,"Anything like an AI tool for ""simple"" Docker orchestration?","Like many, I've been playing around with a lot of AI tools for development-related tasks lately, and in particular one called Windsurf.

The conclusion I've reached is that their efficacy for coding is very much hit and miss and I give the technology a couple more years before it's as useful as it could be. Basic batch scripting in Python is fine, but for anything that hasn't seen lots of training data, it's simply too often frustrating. 

Strangely, by virtue of the fact that some of these agents can connect to remote environments, I've actually begun to find them much more helpful in basic DevOps type operations. 

Things like diagnosing connectivity issues, everything related to Docker orchestration, and even networking.

Note this is for a private stack of AI resources and I'm very much aware that this kind of workflow would be a non-runner for many organisations. However, my batting average for getting reasoning models to troubleshoot DevOps style problems is much better than the usually frustrating task of asking them to debug (say) a frontend.

Prompts that I run all the time and uses that I make in this realm: edit this docker-compose to take out the service or add this as a dependency; Let's change the volume over to this volume; Let's give these containers individual Postgres instances instead of putting them on the same database (etc, etc).

The agent then edits the files and usually actually does a good enough job (and who doesn't like avoiding editing YAML?!)

Given that the utility of these tools seems to depend to such a large extent upon their fine tuning, I was wondering today whether there's actually any AI agents that have been specialised for this exact purpose. 

I very much understand that close supervision is needed for these tools, but I can imagine that with some guardrails and perhaps added on to an existing deployment platform they could be very effective. 

If anyone's aware of such products, please give me some recommendations.

1jd7fop,Karpathy completely changed the way I use Windsurf,"I’ve been coding for years, but I never realized how much time I wasted typing until I stumbled on a video of Karpathy coding entirely with his voice. I thought it was just a gimmick. But turns out, dictating prompts for Windsurf works super well and a lot faster than typing. 



It lets me articulate longer prompts without breaking flow and it’s easier describing logical flows. Apparently 3x faster on average compared to typing. For example, dictating a complex API query prompt now takes seconds of braindumping with my voice instead of minutes.



In the past couple weeks, I’ve tried 3 different ones. 



1. Apple Dictation. This was my first attempt. Let’s just say it didn’t go well. The accuracy isn’t good and latency is terrible. Half the time, I’d finish speaking and stare at the screen waiting for the text to appear, only to realize it had given up halfway through. Only good thing is that it’s free and built-in
2. Dragon Dictation. Sorry, maybe it’s because I’m Unc now. I only realized no one even uses this after paying hundreds of dollars. It used to be really good in the past but no longer supports Mac and has gone downhill since getting acquired by Microsoft. It’s nice for controlling your entire computer but hard to learn. Just doesn’t keep up with the new AI dictation tools
3. WillowVoice. This is the one I current use and I like it. Accuracy is good. Latency is less than a second. It works everywhere and can automatically format an email when I write them. Not much to complain about.



Anyone else tried this? I’m curious if other devs have relaced more of their typing with dictation.

milu2u1,,"Context is always a problem when you're talking about large sizes. There may be some software that has more context than someone else, but in general it's always a problem.


The goal is not to find the software that handles context perfectly, because right now it doesn't exist.
The goal is to learn to manage the amount of context that is offered to us.


For this reason I prefer Cursor:
Windsurf will try to keep track of the entire project, but the bigger the project gets, the more confusing it will be with ""too much"" information.

Instead Cursor has no basic context, in each message you choose which context to provide, so if you have very large projects and you need to make a small change, you can provide the minimal context specific to that change and the AI ​​will be more efficient, not having superfluous information.

Me: No. I did not delete anything. I actually did not know ""\~/.codeium/windsurf” this folder.I just use windsurf UI.



Support: I tried multiple times but i am not able to reproduce this. Did you ever delete the ""\~/.codeium/windsurf"" as that can cause the conversation history to get deleted. Kindly share the info about this. Also, did you lose any chat history after updating windsurf? 

This is ridiculous - I hope someone from Windsurf can see this and reply with more responsibility.

1jez7mu,Windsurf site preview problems,"Hi,

I want to use the Windsurf site preview but seems its not that easy.

In Chat mode, following the official docs and pressing the icon then pressing `Run Preview` simply writes a message to the LLM. I tried both Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7, Cascade Base, Deekseek V3 and Gemini and none of them opens the preview. 

Added the url myself as well: ""http://localhost:3000"" still nothing.

Using cmd+t and searching for Preview I can get to the ""Windsurf Preview"" browser but it wont be connected to Cascade and I cant get logs from it.

In Write mode, it first ran a terminal command of ""open <url>"" which opened Brave, then said `Cascade error`, then `Beta Running Preview` with two buttons ""Open Preview"" and ""Open in External Browser"".

If I click on ""Open Preview"" I finally get a browser and it finally connects to Cascade and shows the little buttons on the bottom right: ""Send element"" and ""Send console errors"" (this preview is open on port 56331). 

However this preview isnt authenticated and it seems like it wont me auth (MSAL).

If I click on ""Open in External browser"" it does eventually open Brave but its not connected at all to Cascade.


Is there a way to get this working?

note that just opening a wsl terminal and typing `windsurf .` won't work, at least for me (it opens the folder but doesn't connect to remote).

here's the **powershell command**:

`wsl windsurf --folder-uri ""vscode-remote://wsl+ubuntu/$(wsl wslpath -a 'C:\\your\\folder\\path')""`

# right-click menu

i also use **nilesoft shell** to customize my right-click menu. here's my setup for both windsurf, vscode, and opening in terminal; replace the `image=...` with your own icon paths:

    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir' title='Open in Code' cmd='code' arg=`@sel.path\.` image=image.svgf('C:\icons\vscode.svg'))

fixed slight mistake with the windsurf nilesoft shell command, it only supports folders in wsl. also more explanation

if you want to make it connect when you type `wf .` you probably have to write your own script and set it as an alias, something like

1jfa369,A Thought on Credit spending && Sharing Windsurf Referrals,"Hey everyone,

I've noticed many of us feel the pinch with the cost of credits .. I personally recharge twice my flex credits twice last month. and it is a bit painful.

I see windsurf is luanching a referral program challenge ending this month and many are posting their referral links, but it get me thinking :

A big part of us here are already paid user , how can we reach out to more people outside of this community, while also helping each other earn those valuable 500 flex credits? as the number of referees are not limited, it could be a big boost in credits pool.

So I spent last week creating a **FREE** platform ([ aicodedeals.com](http://aicodedeals.com)) where people can easily share and find referral links for windsurf ( and other products in coming). The goal is to make it simple to submit your referral link and manage them for different products in one place.

All you need to do is to submit the referral link. 

In the following hours I will be validating your submitted referral link.

Once validated, your link will be distributed in the the product page randomly when any visitor want to get a referral link of windsurf.

Besides , you can always manage and share your referrals in ""my referrals"" page , some popular social media channels are availble to choose from to maximize your referral exposure.

I am working on SEO to get more exposure through Google organic search to [ aicodedeals.com](http://aicodedeals.com).

As someone who built this platform using Windsurf itself (my first personal project online !), I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether this would be a helpful resource for the community. Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated !!!  
\----------------------------------------------

Lastly, I wanted to give a shout-out to the Windsurf team. It's a fantastic tool, and I really appreciate seeing it constantly improve. While it's not perfect (and there are other options), I'm personally rooting for its continued growth. If this post happens to cross any self-promotion lines, I'm sorry and please feel free to remove it.

","I dont mean to be a shill, but have you considered that maybe AI coding is just very expensive right now? I get it. Credits suck. Throttles suck. Shifty performance vs before sucks. But Im coming to the realization that its just not really possible to have it al right now. You can get similar output with significant price reductions by planning every step and executing with aider and R1Claude. But thats a lot more effort. You can use Claude code and get unbelievable results. But you pay for it. You can create your own experience in roo or cline. And find some middle ground between control , customization and automation. But youre juggling cost and effort here too.

mibf2lj,,"I take a contrarian view (it's kinda my jam, you could say).

In the grand scheme of things, AI coding is cheap. Admittedly that's from a privileged position. I make a decent(ish) income and live in a developed country. And even then it's expensive enough to make me wince at how much I'm spending.

But in return I'm getting some scrappy MVPs and some functional pieces of software that do things I've always wanted. if even one of these were professionally developed it would likely cost more than my cumulative spend to date.

What's not cheap (and this is my point in writing this, should anyone read this comment): my time.

During the honeymoon phase I could justify pulling a few all-nighters to babysit Cascade and patiently try to steer it clear of its latest round of self-destruction to ultimately achieve something half-usable. But that's not a sustainable approach.

It's been a really interesting experience, but I have to admit that I'm beginning to feel a bit lukewarm as to the state of the technology at the moment. There's potential for greatness undoubtedly. But it feels like the tech and context handling particularly needs 6 to 12 months of slow brewing to reach any kind of justifiable maturity. 

I think that what Codeium has achieved so far borders on genius. But I think that until the technology is at a place of much more stability, they would do well to charge a little less and be a little more cautious in their approach. ",2025-03-17 15:59:15,2,0,0.0,Codeium,danielrosehill,False,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1jcmzw7/i_dont_mean_to_be_a_shill_but_have_you_considered/mibf2lj/,"I take a contrarian view (it's kinda my jam, you could say).

1jg7kdc,Do I just give up?,"Update from support:

I understand your frustration with Cascade's handling of memories and rules. Let me help clarify how to make the system work better for you:

For optimal results with rules, keep them simple and specific:

* Use bullet points and numbered lists
* Break down rules into clear, concise statements
* Use XML tags to group similar rules together ([read more](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/getting-started#forgot-to-import-vs-code-configurations%3F)) (same for all the read mores down below)

There are technical limitations to be aware of:

* Each rule file (.windsurfrules and global\_rules.md) has a 6,000 character limit
* The combined limit across all rules is 12,000 characters
* Any content beyond these limits will be truncated and not processed by Cascade (read more)

If your rules have become more complex than the project itself, this may actually be reducing their effectiveness. Complex or lengthy rules can confuse Cascade rather than help it. Focus on creating concise, specific guidelines instead of trying to mandate every step of the process. (read more)

For tracking progress and context, Cascade automatically generates and stores relevant memories during conversations. These memories are workspace-specific and don't consume any credits. You can also manually create memories by asking Cascade to ""create a memory of..."" specific important information. (read more)

We are continuously working to improve our systems based on user feedback like yours to enhance reliability and consistency.

Best regards, Codeium Support Team

Original post:

I don't know what to do now. At this point I've written memories and rules that are more complex than the project itself. I keep looking for ways to mandate Claude follows the explicit step by step process, Claude refuses to follow along. This is what I get after it suddenly and repeatedly fails to accomplish the basic task it just got through doing brilliantly yesterday, despite having verified code patterns to follow.

I mean WTF? ""I didn't review the ENTIRE .windsurfrules file as mandated"" What good is having rules and memories if it cherry picks only a few rules or hallucinates just trying to read them?

So frustrated. Zero progress tonight. Several projects are like this. Great first phase progress, then suddenly it's as dumb as a rock.

    You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my significant failure. I did not properly follow the mandatory process that was clearly outlined in the memories:
    
    I failed to thoroughly read the PROGRESS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md file first as required

Update from support:

I understand your frustration with Cascade's handling of memories and rules. Let me help clarify how to make the system work better for you:

For optimal results with rules, keep them simple and specific:

* Use bullet points and numbered lists
* Break down rules into clear, concise statements
* Use XML tags to group similar rules together ([read more](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/getting-started#forgot-to-import-vs-code-configurations%3F)) (same for all the read mores down below)

There are technical limitations to be aware of:

* Each rule file (.windsurfrules and global\_rules.md) has a 6,000 character limit
* The combined limit across all rules is 12,000 characters
* Any content beyond these limits will be truncated and not processed by Cascade (read more)

If your rules have become more complex than the project itself, this may actually be reducing their effectiveness. Complex or lengthy rules can confuse Cascade rather than help it. Focus on creating concise, specific guidelines instead of trying to mandate every step of the process. (read more)

For tracking progress and context, Cascade automatically generates and stores relevant memories during conversations. These memories are workspace-specific and don't consume any credits. You can also manually create memories by asking Cascade to ""create a memory of..."" specific important information. (read more)

We are continuously working to improve our systems based on user feedback like yours to enhance reliability and consistency.

Original post:

I don't know what to do now. At this point I've written memories and rules that are more complex than the project itself. I keep looking for ways to mandate Claude follows the explicit step by step process, Claude refuses to follow along. This is what I get after it suddenly and repeatedly fails to accomplish the basic task it just got through doing brilliantly yesterday, despite having verified code patterns to follow.

I mean WTF? ""I didn't review the ENTIRE .windsurfrules file as mandated"" What good is having rules and memories if it cherry picks only a few rules or hallucinates just trying to read them?

So frustrated. Zero progress tonight. Several projects are like this. Great first phase progress, then suddenly it's as dumb as a rock.

    You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my significant failure. I did not properly follow the mandatory process that was clearly outlined in the memories:
    
    I failed to thoroughly read the PROGRESS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md file first as required

I understand you're experiencing issues with Cascade not loading. Here's what you can do to resolve this:

1. Delete the Cascade folder located at: C:\\Users<YOUR\_USERNAME>.codeium\\windsurf\\cascade
2. Restart your IDE after deleting the folder

1jbv6yw,Is there a way to disable Cascade memories?,"So Cascade Memories seems like a nice idea in theory, however in practice I've begun to find it really troublesome. 

For example, I've recently been working on a few Docker-based Dev Ops projects for deployments of various stacks onto servers and have been using Windsurf to expedite the tedious process of writing multiple Docker Compose files. On the surface, they look like very similar ""things"", but each one is a completely different project with very unique requirements.

One of the stacks (an AI stack) used Langflow. Comically, until it became hugely frustrating, Codeium decided that Langflow should be called ""LandGraph"" and botched the docker-compose and .env by referring to the wrong project. 

I thought that I had finally exorcised ""Landgraph"" from my life but alas, working on a completely different project a week later, Cascade has decided that my current (unrelated) project must be the same thing as I was working on a week ago. Apparently, a memory had been formed along the lines of ""the user uses Landgraph"".

Thus, while executing one of its flows, I noticed that Cascade had taken the executive decision that ""LandGraph"" needed to be added back to this project. Not for the first time, I found myself writing angrily in all caps to a bot: ""THERE IS NO LANDGRAPH. WTH ARE YOU DOING!?!?""

1jcnygr,RANT: I just want it to work...,"I'm on 1.4.6 and I don't understand why it takes so long to copy anything? Before starting this post I cut a line from the document and pasted it to a new line. In the time that I have pulled up reddit and written this post I'm still looking at the stupid progress circle spin as it thinks about if it's actually going to paste the content. I already had to stop my conversation and start a new one since the delay for trying to type anything in the Cascade window was getting stupid long. Even though I see that the typing delay has been an issue for multiple months? Starting a new conversation fixed the delay, but now I have a dumb Cascade that is making mistakes all the time because it doesn't know about the prior conversations we have had.

Hey, it finally finished the paste function like 3 or 4 minutes later. 

While I appreciate some of what has been accomplished like being being able to consistently execute terminal functions without getting stuck like Cursor does, please figure out a way to manage context length.  Having to tell Cascade to think sequentially and break edits down into smaller segments when it is only trying to add a couple hundred line edit is really becoming frustrating since I shouldn't be anywhere near Claude 3.7's response context limit length. This significantly increases the time it takes for anything to be accomplished. Especially when it can't find the end of the file that it just created from the sequential edit during it's last action. 

Just last night when it couldn't figure out how to find the last line in the file, it started making edits in a 2 step terminal command process where it created a temp file and then applied that temp file to the end of the target file as a second terminal command. This chewed though a bunch of flow credits before I figured out what it was doing. I've settled on telling it to look at the last couple of lines in the end of a file before trying to perform the edit a second time if the first time fails due to a syntax issue. But this is yet another thing that slows any progress down.

Again, I generally like Windsurf as an AI coding agent. But I find myself just making extra global rules in an attempt to fix all of the issues it has. It seems like rules should be for tailoring the AI agent to how you like to work, not as a way to fix issues that the program has that make it difficult to be productive with it.

1jf9mvb,Codeium - fix the pricing! 4th attempt.,"My post has been killed 3 times by Codeium admins, apparenty because I mentioned we chose a competitor product and it is forbidden by the terms and conditions of this group to talk about competition.   
  
to the ones that did not read one of my three posts - we had to decide to invest a signifficant amount of seats (100) for our teams and after doing analysis we had to decide for a competitor product (you need to guess which as I am not allowed to promote).  
  
The product pricing is illogical and using it proposed way (using cascade/agent mode) it is impossible to use the your premium credits in advanced way because you will run out of flow credits while left with around 50% of premium llm credits.  
  
now your options are:  
  
pay $15 for 500 llm credits and 1500 flow  
pay $60 for unlimited llm and 3000 flow  
  
the unlimited in $60 is conditionally ""useless"" because after relatively short period you will have spent your 3000 flow credits and be left with unlimited premium calls you cannot use in advanced way (or to say it differently - there are competitor product we have at hand that are cheaper for that purpose enabling access to the same llm models)  
  
if you go for $15 they give option to buy extra flex credits $10 for 300 which is pretty expensive.  
  
it is cheaper to open 4 $15 account which would give you access to 2000 premium llm calls and 6000 flow credits for $60.  
  
**Now, user** u/Dullirium **left a comment under one of my removed posts that it is them building MAU (monthly active users). And congratulations, apparently you were right. After posting here I have been privately contacted by a profile connected to the company, and verified on Linkedin - this is exactly what is happening.

We, the users are kind of a collateral damage because future funding relies on that number.

mi66n4q,,"What I'm saying is not contradictory. I just didn't want to muddy the waters of the OPs post. I've been a happy Cursor user for a couple of months now. Most of my work goes in to the ""Included In Pro"" bucket on my usage. I'm predominately using Claud Sonnet 3.7 unless it gets stuck on something and I switch to OpenAI for a different viewpoint to the problem. I can maintain a high level of productivity with Cursor generating many times my regular output with it's assistance. The only 2 issues that I have with it are that I can't get an MCP to work on it despite applying the solutions on the web and that as a windows user, it is inconsistent on being able to run terminal commands. Sometimes it hangs and I have to override and run it manually. When I spent 2 days trying to fix something on my server getting frustrated with the terminal command issues I opened a Windsurf account and was able to fix the problem with Cascade's help in a couple of hours. 

So the one thing that I've found that Windsurf does better for me is terminal commands.

I then used Windsurf for 3 days using up over half of the flow-credit. Windsurf's response window is extremely limited requiring the creation of a rule to break long file edits into multiple smaller edits so that they stayed within the context window limitations. This caused me to significantly reduce the amount of progress I was making since what should have taken 1 update often turned into 2-4 updates. Then I ran into the problem that it would forget what the previous sequential update ended in which would cause the next update to fail repeatedly causing me to have to create a rule that if it is doing a sequential update to a file and it didn't remember the last couple rows from the previous update that it should search for the last couple of rows and then apply the update. At one point it started sending my edits to a temp file as a terminal command and then applying the contents of the file in another terminal command. 

During this whole process my typing was starting to lag in the cascade window and I gradually noticed that I was getting a progress indicator when trying to paste into the code pane. Both these issue got worse until this morning when I was typing full sentences into the Cascade input and then waiting for them to appear and the I pasted a line of text to move it's location and after waiting 30 seconds I went on reddit to search is anyone else was having a similar problem. By the time I had been typing my post for a couple of minutes it still hadn't finished my paste command. I later did some searching and discovered that this lag issue has been a know bug for over 2 months.

Now I know that as long as I don't need to do something terminal command intensive, Cursor works great for what I need and Windsurf doesn't.

So what I was trying to say in my original post wasn't that it wasn't worth $235 to use a tool that met my needs. In the end, Windsurf and Cursor are just a tacked on module to VS Code to expose an LLM to a user for assisted code editing. If Windsurf did that significantly better than the competition, then they would be able to set their own price. But, they aren't significantly better than Cursor.

   * Flow Action credits are consumed for each tool call (e.g., View file, Search, Write, Terminal).
2. Options when out of Flow Action credits but have User Prompt credits:
   * Purchase premium Flex credits to continue using premium features.
   * Use Write or Chat mode with the Cascade Base model (no credits used).
   * Use Legacy mode to use premium User Prompt credits without Flow Action credits.
3. Flex credits:
   * These are versatile credits that can be used as both User Prompt and Flow Action credits.
   * They act as a backup when you run out of either type of credit.

1jf7ll8,My First Fully AI Developed WebApp,"Well I did it... Took me 2 months and about $500 dollars in open router credit but I developed and shipped my app using 99% AI prompts and some minimal self coding. To be fair $400 of that was me learning what not to do. But I did it. So I thought I would share some critical things I learned along the way.

  
1. Know about your stack. you don't have to know it inside and out but you need to know it so you can troubleshoot.

2. Following hype tools is not the way... I tried cursor, windsurf, bolt, so many. VS Code and Roo Code gave me the best results. 

3. Supabase is cool, self hosting it is troublesome. I spent a lot of credits and time trying to make this work in the end I had a few good versions using it and always ran into some sort of pay wall or error I could not work around. Supabase hosted is okay but soo expensive. (Ended up going with my own database and auth.)

4. You have to know how to fix build errors. Coolify, dokploy, all of them are great for testing but in the end I had to build myself. Maybe if i had more time to mess with them but I didn't. Still a little buggy for me but the webhook deploy is super useful. 

5. You need to be technical to some degree in my experience. I am a very technical person and have a lot of understanding when it comes to terms and how things work. So when something was not working I could guess what the issue was based on the logs and console errors. Those that are not may have a very hard time.

6. Do not give up use it to learn. Review the code changes made and see what is happening. 

So what did I build... I built a storage app similar to drop box. Next.js... It has RBAC, uses Minio as a storage backend, Prisma and Postgres in the backend as well.  Auto backup via s3 to a second location daily. It is super fast way faster than drop box. Searches with huge amounts of files and data are near instant due to how its indexed. It performs much better than any of the open source apps we tried. Overall super happy with it and the outcome... now onto maintaining it.

1jgbjll,Love to generating my own data,"I’m a data engineer. Mosly using 3rd party data sources to build some personal projects to improve myself on my field. But I’ve always loved generating my own data. It is more cool about owning the data you work with. I’m also a big F1 fan and lately I’ve been playing F1 24 on my PS. That game lets you pull realtime telemetry, so I started test with it using Python. Then I thought, why not try something similar for my realife driving.

My 2012 VW Jetta isn’t spilling any telemetry data, so I turned to my iPhone instead. I built a little iOS app (called it Transporter Telemetry - I love that movie btw) to record stuff like speed, location, and distance every second. I leaned on Cursor and Windsurf to code it since I have zero knowledge about mobile development. It was a mess at first, bugs, GPS hiccups and figuring out SwiftUI took some sweat. The last 30% of the app felt like a slog, but I got it working.

The fun part is the dashboard. I paired the data generated it with a Next.js dashboard (The Transporter - yes still love that movie) to visualize my trips, max speed, average speed, total distance, even a map view. Seeing my daily commute plotted out was oddly satisfying. Plus, tinkering with AI tools like Cursor for the web stuff made me feel like I was cheating a bit, but in a good way.

I wrote up more about whole thing, F1 inspiration, the app struggles, the dashboard link in there: [denizaa.com/driving-analytics](http://denizaa.com/driving-analytics) .
