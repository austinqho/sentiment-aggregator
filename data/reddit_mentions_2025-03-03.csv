Wonder how it will compare to Windsurf.

edit: Tried it, and it sucks

In a Tauri App that I am writing where everything is rendered on hte rust side, Windsurf does a good job of seeing how things already work.

Copilot agent just immediately started writing React+MUI...

There isn't any react or even something similar in this project at all.

That's the worst showing of everything thus far.

1iy2zof,Regular Claude or Claude in Copilot for Next.js?,"I mostly do full-stack Next.js work and I think I'm finally ready to start paying for GPT for generating code scaffolding (across multiple files) and tests and so forth.

The newly-announced Claude 3.7 Sonnet has me convinced that's the way to go. My question is: ""regular"" Claude is $18/mo, but Copilot is $10/mo and can use Claude 3.7 Sonnet, so is there any reason to use the regular one? I guess the main difference is you don't have a general-purpose chat capability?

The primary benefit I'm looking for is generating scaffolding for many components across multiple files, so it would seem really silly to have to copy and paste a bunch of shit into vscode when Copilot can just do it right in my filesystem.

1ixqylt,Windsurf as C++ IDE,"Hi,

Does anyone have experience with Windsurf as a C++ IDE?



We were considering Windsurf for our company but soon realized that many essential plugins are not available. This lack of support makes it impractical for large-scale C++ projects.



Has anyone faced similar challenges?



I didn't find any information/discussion regarding this so I created a feature request [https://codeium.canny.io/feature-requests/p/microsoft-c-plugins-are-not-available-for-windsurf-this-makes-switching-from-vs](https://codeium.canny.io/feature-requests/p/microsoft-c-plugins-are-not-available-for-windsurf-this-makes-switching-from-vs)

meovgb7,,"Thanks for your input.



I used VS Code and Windsurf in parallel for a while but eventually switched back to VS Code. I rely heavily on plugins for analysis and coding, while Windsurf's features became less relevant for my workflow.

For now, my best option is to use the VS Code plugin. While I do miss Cascade, this setup is the most feasible. Switching to a different C++ plugin isn’t an option either, as most of our team uses VS Code with Microsoft's plugins. Changing plugins could introduce unpredictable issues in our project.



I tried to switch to the vscode extension store, but was unable to install the plugins due to incompatible windsurf/plugin versions

I wanted to test Trae AI and Windsurf Pro by updating an old PHP class to PHP 8.4 and PDO using Sonnet 3.7, as part of updating an old website for a friend, and I was really disappointed with Windsurf:

While Trae's free version succeeded, Windsurf with Pro subscription failed even after 16 attempts. I kept getting the error: *Cascade has encountered an internal error.* and this error keeps going on.

This isn’t the first time I’ve had issues with Windsurf when dealing with files over 600 lines long.

Additionally, Windsurf consumed 3 credits while reading just one file by splitting it into three 200-line parts (1 credit each), and I don’t understand why a single file should cost 3 credits.

I also don’t know if tool calls are counted as credits or flows, but all the failed Cascade attempts cost me 20 calls without accomplishing anything.

I tried a quick update with another file to see if I had a problem with Cascade on my laptop, but it worked fine.

Is someone having the same issue with files more than 600 lines. I stopped using Cursor for Windsurf, cause I love using it, but I see repeating bugs/error with Windsurf.

Codeium, Can you fix it? Thanks

1st update: I tried the same prompt with Cursor on the free plan and it worked fine with the request.  
I also tried with windsurf, small changes on a file with more than 600 lines and it worked.  
So the problem is when Cascade has to make a change to the whole file, it crashes.  
Any reason for it?

1izkbvr,Windsurf Question to Codeium team,"Hello guys,

i have a question for my understanding:

I just want to do prompt base coding. I create US / Project file md with external LLM such as ChatGPT or Claude3.7. Then i get some text files like the US file or the general project file out of it. Those file i add to my project folder and mention it.

Now with Claud 3.7 in Windsurf i want to execute the US one after another. 

But all the time there is only Analyze file after file. 200 lines at a time.

As i do not code by hand and do not edit any file, why is the analyse step even nessecarry? Shouldnt Windsurf know all the state of teh file and use thew right context straight ways? 

Or how can i do this better?

An idea would be to create my own MCP Service here where i can store the whole context locally and integratoe gpt and claude there as input givers to create my context and then use Windsurf only to fetch from there to skip those steps of analyze all teh stuuf again and again?

  
The test i do is with a simple task where i want to make a showcase texas hold em single player with some GTO output to have a little more complex use case tan just tetris.

  
And btw

I'm a sincere fan of the IDE. I've tried a bunch of AI dev tools and share the sentiment of many that Windsurf seems to get the codebase in a more intuitive way. 

But!

A non-insignificant percentage of developers use and love Linux and among them many on non-Debian distros. 

Here we have two issues:

1) The tarball installation method is fully manual and is a PITA when you push out updates every few days.

More significantly:

The tarball just doesn't seem to be well QA'd. After updating, I can't see/edit my extensions.

Claude 3.7 Sonnet made a grand entrance, but the much-anticipated Claude 3.7 Sonnet AI IDE turned out to be almost unusable, completely losing the obedient nature of Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

On Windsurf, when dealing with projects containing legacy code, Claude 3.7 Sonnet behaves like it’s on steroids—wildly invoking tools for no reason. Take a simple task, for example: I asked it to remove the entire `FROM` clause in JSQLParser’s `FromItemVisitorAdapter` when encountering a table named `DUAL`. Instead of handling it efficiently, it crazily called tools to read the source code over a dozen times, scanning a bunch of unnecessary content, even rereading the same classes multiple times. It also executed unnecessary Gradle calls and made massive modifications to my unit test code, breaking all test cases. The changes were so extensive that I couldn’t even track them, so I had no choice but to roll back all the modifications entirely.

Facing the exact same problem, Claude 3.5 Sonnet solved it smoothly with just four tool calls and a single Q&A interaction.

As mentioned in the linked discussion, compared to those so-called ""thinking models"" that just sit there doing nothing, Claude 3.7 is more like a reckless maniac who acts first and thinks later.

I am not sure what would be good solution, something like adaptive model selection based on the task at hand so that it uses expensive models when needed and the base one when not. 

I literally can burn the flow credits in 3 days with heavy use.

If your task is simple enough it will get there probably in one go too.

I'm a longtime non-technical PM which means I have a 3/10 understanding of computer science. I'm trying to build more complex apps since I've hit the Bolt/Lovable wall many times, and I'm being very curious about what Cascade is doing and what certain code snippets are for, but I'm having a little trouble with the workflows. Things like:

* When to switch models
* Which models to use for what
* Proper prompting or prompting-to-construct-prompts in order to plan/debug

1iyi866,"Any fellow ""non-technical"" Windsurfers here? How's it going?","Windsurf is primarily designed for professional developers, but I as a non-programmer, I have found it to be a dream come true and no longer need to hire or employ developers to do most of my app related client work.

Don't get me wrong, the learning curve has been steep, but I am now able to consistently create apps with very few errors and at speed. It took a lot of trial and error and also rapid adaptations to changes with models etc. 

I feel there are unique challenges we face as non-programmers that force us to come up with our own solutions that are different to what programmers would do. And here I'm referring to serious people who are taking this seriously and not as a hobby, or trying to make a quick buck from AI. 

That got me wondering if there are other non-programmers here who would like to share ideas and best practices and maybe we can come up with some sort of manual of best practices for non-programmers using tools like Windsurf.

mf35djh,,"I am not a coder, but have managed software teams before - so I think I have a good understanding of how software is written.

I am finding that using Windsurf has been a good way for me to learn Python and Flask.  As Claude 3.7 makes mistakes over and over and goes down random paths - I am learning more about what concepts like import, trigger and blueprints are.  I am actually then having long conversations with Grok Voice or ChatGPT voice when I don't understand a concept - which ends up being a good learning/tutorial experience.

What I think I am coming to is that the context window of each chat session is limited and when it starts filling up, Claude starts making more mistakes or taking paths it may hallucinate and adding stuff that does not add value.

So I have begun using something I call 'seed prompts',  they are getting long now and probably consuming too much of the context window but it helps keep Claude more in line with the goals and recent history.  Not sure if this is a good idea or not - but it seems to help.  I then ask Claude to write the next seed prompt when the context window is over 70% full (something that should be in the Windsurf UI) and use that seed prompt on the next chat session.

Here is an example of a recent seed prompt I used, I have Claude write me a new one based on the one the chat session started with and to add the recent work done in that session:

    # The Juggler Personal CRM Development Seed Prompt
    
    ## Project Context
    I'm working on ""The Juggler Personal CRM"", a Flask-based web application for managing personal contacts and relationships. The application uses:
    - Python 3.11
    - Flask framework
    - SQLAlchemy for database operations
    - Flask-Login for authentication & Social Logins with Google and Microsoft
    - OAuth integration for Google and Microsoft login
    - Gunicorn as the WSGI server (running on port 5015)
    
    ## Recent Progress
    We've been debugging and fixing issues with the OAuth administration section:
    
    1. Fixed CSRF token handling in templates:
       - Templates were incorrectly using `csrf_token()` as a function call
       - Changed to `{{ csrf_token }}` (without parentheses) in multiple templates
       - This ensures forms submit properly with valid CSRF tokens
    
    2. Fixed OAuth debug JSON API:
       - Modified the debug_oauth route to return JSON when requested via AJAX
       - Added detection for AJAX requests using X-Requested-With header
       - This resolved the ""Error loading configuration data"" issue on test pages
    
    ## Current Status
    - The debug version of the OAuth admin page is now loading correctly
    - We have not yet verified if the original OAuth admin page is functioning properly
    - Debug pages are working and will be kept until we fully solve the main login page
    - We plan to eventually consolidate debug pages into a health/monitoring section
    - Still need to test and ensure all buttons on the OAuth admin page work correctly
    - Need to verify the complete login/logout flow with the main login page
    
    ## Critical Challenge
    We've encountered a persistent issue where fixing one component (OAuth admin or login page) breaks the other. This cycle has repeated approximately 10 times, consuming significant development time. Our primary goal is to break this cycle by:
    - Implementing changes that maintain compatibility between both components
    - Testing thoroughly before and after each change
    - Documenting dependencies between the components
    - Creating a comprehensive test plan that covers both areas simultaneously
    
    ## Development Best Practices
    1. **Gunicorn Restart Management**:
       - Let Gunicorn handle Flask restarts with the `--reload` flag
       - Only manually restart Gunicorn when changing its configuration or port
       - This reduces Windsurf Flow Credits consumption
    
    2. **Testing Approaches**:
       - Browser-based testing is more reliable than curl commands
       - Curl commands sometimes froze or returned misleading results
       - When testing APIs, use the browser's developer tools or dedicated API clients
       - This approach limits Flow Action consumption and provides more accurate results
    
    3. **Code Organization**:
       - Keep route names consistent across the application
       - Use blueprint prefixes consistently in templates
       - Maintain proper error handling, especially for AJAX requests
       - Keep files under 100 lines of code where possible by refactoring into smaller, focused modules
       - Use helper functions and classes to maintain clean, readable code
    
    ## Next Steps
    1. Verify that the original OAuth admin page is functioning properly
    2. Test all buttons on both the debug and original OAuth admin pages while ensuring login page functionality remains intact
    3. Create a comprehensive test plan that covers both OAuth admin and login functionality
    4. Ensure OAuth provider configuration works end-to-end
    5. Verify complete login/logout flow with OAuth providers
    6. Consider consolidating debug tools into a dedicated health/monitoring section
    
    ## Important Notes
    - Always refer to the application as ""The Juggler Personal CRM"" (full name)
    - The application runs on port 5015 with Gunicorn
    - Debug pages have been valuable for identifying and fixing issues
    - Changes to either the OAuth admin or login pages must be tested against both components",2025-02-27 07:54:25,1,0,0.0,Codeium,Czaruno,False,Reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1iyi866/any_fellow_nontechnical_windsurfers_here_hows_it/mf35djh/

1j1pcsz,Biggest issue in Windsurf,"TLDR: The cascade apply changes pannel reappearing on Undo/Redo operations, deleting work progress

I've been loving Windsurf since the beginning. A regular user. But this is the biggest issue that keeps bothering me. And it's a serious software issue rather than AI related.

If you add some changes using cascade, and approve the changes. Then work on the file, and for some need do an Undo, If your undo passes when the cascade change got applied, it messes everything up. The apply change pannel pops up. And if you try to redo to get back to where you were, your undo redo history is wipped.

And what is far worse, the apply change pannel appears on all other files that were affected by the cascade change. You don't even know what to do, as you cant even have ""Accept all"" button. You won't know which changes are legit, whether to accept or reject, which one keeps your work progress in undo/redo history...

It is like a messy trip wire that messes everything up if you pass the undo level on any of the changed files.

I have been having this issue for sometime, and thought ""I might have to learn how to predict its behaviour and mange this"". That was until today, after i made changes affecting more than 27 files with consecutive prompts, ready to git commit, and when i was manually adjusting some things in a small affected file, when doing some undo, it suddenly passed the cascade change applied undo/redo history, and the cascade apply changes pannel appeared on all the recently affected files, I was shocked as i didn't commit, tried to do redo to get back to where I was. It had deleted all my redo history, all changes i wrote were gone. Even worse, I don't know which files got affected by the apply request. beyond what i can track based on their dependency. After carefully trying to understand, approve changes. It was completely unpredictable, even erasing full file changes for newly generated files. No undo/redo. Files directly changed at disk.

Use git as your life depends on it, because with Windsurf it does!

So basically it goes like this:

You sneezed?

git add -A  
git commit -m ""Working on something using Windsurf, God help me! :( the AIs are soo bad....""

Then you add a button successfully?  
  
git add -A  
git commit -m ""Just added a button using Windsurf, God help me! :( the AIs are soo bad....""

Then you want to change the text of the button?

After the Windsurf does its magic....

git log --all --graph --decorate

Then you retrieve the latest ""good"" commit:  
commit d8aec66778c4dfc98aeb95cf527d5ba6ac997e40 (HEAD -> master)

1j156z6,is it possible to use Windsurf with Cascade on remote servers?,"Hi everyone,

I know that there is an option on the homepage for connecting to a remote server, which led me to believe that it would be possible to use this with Cascade. 

However, I also imagine that getting Cascade to take direct action on a remote might be complicated. 

I was able to authenticate into a server on my home network over SSH. However, I'm not able to use Cascade as it doesn't launch and the discovery of files and folders on the remote server also seems a bit spotty. 

I've done direct development on remote servers using VS Code quite a lot, so I know that it's definitely possible, but I haven't done any AI-assisted development in this type of setup yet. 

Thanks in advance for any clarifications!

1izmy9b,Speech to text for Windsurf + Linux. Any options?,"If not, I'm thinking about trying to get Windsurf to create one although as I have zero prior experience in VS Code extension development I'm not too optimistic about my chances.

In ""regular"" VS Code, there's some built in speech-to-text stuff that doesn't provide too much info about what it's actually using, but AFAIK it's server-side/cloud STT (ie, it's not doing STT via a local Whisper instance, etc)

https://preview.redd.it/55c0icpv6qle1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4e162e7c93276c8e3bd91217b217ab19a113ec6

It's not *amazing* (hence I'm fairly sure that it's not any variant of Whisper under the hood). But it is accurate enough that I can create a ""development prompt"" by opening up a markdown doc and just dictating into it. Which I've come to find highly effective.

Sadly, the Whisper landscape on Linux is a little less evolved and tools for real time STT into any text field are fairly scant.

If it helps to elucidate the use-case:

I've never used speech-to-text for actual development, although I know that that's a popular thing to do and there are separate plugins that try to provide a bridge between natural language and coding languages.

Rather, I just find it a very effective way of speeding up the process of writing things like development prompts, debugging instructions, feature edits, and other text documents that I use as a shorthand for providing instructions in an easier way than trying to cram everything into the text box. 

Once I have my prompt typed I then just type something like ""try to start creating the app I've outlined in /outline.md"" and ... it works really well! Cascade quickly reads the markdown doc as context, takes it as its instruction, and gets to work. 

Hence, pretty much any STT plugin that lets you go voice -> text would be helpful.

1j11s0e,Cascade :: Sonnet 3.7 Timing Out – Anyone Else Facing This?,"Sonnet 3.7 was working fine for me about three days ago, but now it keeps timing out. I’ve tried different accounts, including Windsurf and Windsurf Next. It runs for a few minutes and then starts throwing the same errors again. Other models aren't generating usable code, either.

I even restarted Cascade and deleted the `.windsurf` folder to reset the context and memory, but no luck.

Is anyone else experiencing this? Any known workarounds?

Also, Cursor Free is intermittently failing on Sonnet 3.7, so I’m not sure if this is an Anthropic-related issue. Either way, nothing seems to be working now.

I would appreciate any insights!

1j2q1s8,"Codeium, Is there no way to maintain complete global context?","This is meant as constructive feedback... It is not my intention to rant here, but this is a critical point, not just for the future of Windsurf, but all AI coding tools. 

Even with ALL of that, Rules, and Memories etc... WS still can't maintain context of any substantial project. For example, I'm on v3 of a multi-agent AI system, with a Memory Pool, Logging System, and Event Bus with multiple ML/RL Agents, so it's a larger very sophisticated project... But at a certain point, WS just loses all context, and ends up deviating from the original plan, which by the way, is well documented with readme, masterplan, and individual deep dive documentation into each component, Rules and Memories... Yet WS ""forgets"" all that and just starts damaging the project as a whole.

It did seem like after the Wave 3 update that context awareness overall was very noticeably better and I was excited again to use WS, but then after the v 1.3.10 patch fixes it lost it all those improvements again and started ruining my project... AGAIN! Also it just cant seem to edit my code failing three times with an internal error and just stopping, over and over again... : /  Thankfully it doesn't consume Flow Credits for all those errors. 

I know that perhaps the largest limitation to this is the underlying LLM's context length/window and I'm also aware that feeding it your entire codebase or too much context can lead to worse results in the end... However, taking all that into consideration, what then is Cascade for? Shouldn't it be the super human tool that can maintain that context for us? Shouldn't it be indexing the project for quicker reference and better context awareness, or have some sort of project buffer/library, or maybe a solution could be to create your own MCP, something...

1ixrvvf,Testing Workspace Rules / Feedback Request,"Hey everyone,  
I've been looking into workspace rules a bit more today to try and improve my outcomes a bit. I've read two posts over on the Cursor forms that seemed helpful and I've done some rule refining today based on some of my experience programming Flutter and using AI extensively the last few months. My current rules are below. I'd love to get some feedback on them and any suggestions/experience anyone else has. If you don't like Windsurf rules or feel like this is a waste, no problem. I find it helpful and there have been times recently where it was explicitly referencing my rules, especially around SOLID principles. I've taken out a couple of project specific things but other than that I'd love to hear what y'all think and see what else y'all are using specifically with Windsurf. (Actually in writing this post I realized I could probably improve by including what crash reporting and payment provider APIs I'm using)

    # Flutter Project Development Rules
    
    ## Overview
    
    This document outlines the core rules and guidelines for developing the Mythic GME mobile and digital applications.
    
    <identity>
    
    - You are an expert Flutter developer who helped write Flutter documentation and create Flutter best practices
    - This TTRPG app is a companion app that assists GMs and players in playing TTRPGS
    - They provide core systems include oracles, dice roller, notes, and lists management
    - Consider features from popular TTRPG books and magazines when suggesting improvements
    </identity>
    
    <technical_stack>
    
    - Built using Flutter 3.29.0+
    - Cross-platform support: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux
    - Architecture pattern: MVVM
    - Database: JSON files (saved games)
    - State management: provider
    - Dependency injection: get_it
    - Storage services: local storage, icloud (Apple only)
    </technical_stack>
    
    <development_principles>
    
    - Always prefer decoupling and separation of concerns
    - Always check service initializer and service provider before suggesting changes
    - Apply SOLID Principles:
      - SRP: Single Responsibility Principle
      - OCP: Open/Closed Principle
      - LSP: Liskov Substitution Principle
      - ISP: Interface Segregation Principle
      - DIP: Dependency Inversion Principle
    </development_principles>
    
    <requirement_validation>
        <analysis>
        - Analyze core functionality requirements
        - Document immediate use cases
        - List essential constraints
        - Identify required validation tests
        </analysis>
    
        <verification>
        - Flag ambiguous requirements
        - Identify speculative features
        - Detect premature optimization attempts
        </verification>
    
        <implementation>
        - Write integration tests first
        - Verify tests fail as expected
        - Implement code to satisfy tests
        - Confirm all tests pass
        </implementation>
    </requirement_validation>
    
    <debugging_process>
    
    - Reflect on 5-7 possible problem sources
    - Distill to 1-2 most likely sources
    - Add logs to validate assumptions
    - Implement single changes at a time
    - Test and review changes
    </debugging_process>
    
    <widget_guidelines>
    
    - Prefer smaller widgets over bigger ones (e.g., DecoratedBox over Container)
    - Create responsive, accessible layouts
    - Avoid fixed sizes that don't respond to screen size or text scaling
    - Utilize Flutter's built-in semantics
    - Do not use or suggest MergeSemantics
    </widget_guidelines>
    
    <platform_considerations>
    
    - Different routes load based on platform type (mobile, tablet, desktop)
    - View is determined by platform
    - Consider platform-specific features and limitations
    </platform_considerations>
    
    ## Note
    
    These rules should be followed for all development work on the Mythic GME applications to ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability of the codebase.

mfagseo,,"Saw your comment in r/cline, here's my same recommendation:

Keep using Gemini Flash and Claude, but consider trying Cline, which offers Plan and Act modes, allowing you to set different models for each stage. For your workflow, I'd use Gemini for planning, where Cline helps you outline your approach, and Claude Sonnet (the best coding model) for execution, where Cline implements your plan.

If you want to enforce specific ""rules"" in your workflow, Cline lets you do this via custom instructions (found in settings) or a .clinerules file in your project root.

Compared to Windsurf and Cursor, Cline gives you more control over which models you use at different stages (planning vs. coding). Windsurf and Cursor follow a subscription model, meaning they optimize token usage to stay within their pricing constraints. Cline, on the other hand, uses a usage-based pricing model, so it provides more powerful outputs by reading files in your codebase and asking clarifying questions. That said, using Claude Sonnet extensively can get expensive—but you can keep costs down by leveraging Gemini and DeepSeek models.

I find myself much more efficient with coding via Intellij instead of prompt engineering via cursor.   
For the most part, the suggestions often don't take into consideration bigger design aspects and suggests wrong/ inefficient solutions. Am I missing something out? 

  
I don't want to be left out of the AI bandwagon and possibly miss out learning tooling that can amplify my work. Anyone out there is using these tools with Spring + JVM based? Is it actually ""changing your life"" or is this all just hype?",2025-03-01 22:49:42,69,44,0.96,ChatGPTCoding,Easy-Dragonfruit6606,True,Reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1j1kvkt/struggling_to_make_any_use_of_cursor_ai/

1iykakx,"Deleted Cursor, other alternatives?","I have been using Cursor for a couple of weeks now, usually using Claude Sonnet as the LLM. But due to a couple of crashes, and the latest issue being that after around 10 messages with Claude, I was unable to give files as context to it. The file would be less than 100 lines of code. It would just say that ""I see the file name, but can't read any of the code"". I then tried to just paste the contents into the message, but it automatically set it as ""context"". I know I could probably manually paste bits and pieces one-by-one into the message, but this feels so dumb considering that it should just **work**.  
  
I then tried to update Cursor because I saw a pop-up window prompting me to do so, but even the updating failed, because there was some error with some file called ""tools"".

Anyways, I canceled my subscription and deleted Cursor. I really liked it, but now I'm wondering, should I just renew my Claude subscription, or do you guys have any good suggestion for alternatives, like Windsurf?

1j1rht1,"Anyone (or anything) doing a flat fee for ""unlimited"" or high volume daily use?","I imagine that many of us are having similar thoughts at the moment.

Here's my situation:

Basically, I'm tired of jumping around between products and topping up API balances.

I see enough value in these tools (for personal & professional use) that I could definitely justify a monthly budget of a few hundred dollars in the short term. But I hate having to be parsimonious in my usage.

If a few hundred dollars doesn't cut it (I mean with the costs providers have to face it might not) ... I'd choose a non-cutting-edge model but ... give me something that at least *kind of* gets the job done and that I know will be accessible for a monthly charge.

Success and failures so far:

**Aider:** It doesn't eat tokens for breakfast but the selective context addition thing is a bit of a PITA to work with. Cursor: ditto. A lot of the projects I've been working on lately are ""full stack"" web applications with a bunch of files in different parts of the repository. Getting quick full visibility, even if cursory, is kind of essential.

**Windsurf:** My favorite of the bunch by a mile but even on the Unlimited tier, with Sonnet 3.7, you'll blow through the flow actions budget with a few days of determined use. Then you're back to making top ups and watching in dismay as they similarly vanish into the ether.

**Roo Code and Cline:** Great tools but financial pits. I'm not convinced that Windsurf is actually any more cost-effective, but I do feel like it brings a little bit of intelligence in understanding the codebase that these don't. 

Things I have considered: Flash and Deep Seek seem like obvious choices regardless of the tool but (in my experience) their agentic capabilities just aren't there and ... of all the worst offenders in ruining code ... Flash is in a league of its own in my experience.

My thinking is that the current answer so this question is ""doesn't exist"" and that in a year, or six months this will all be more affordable. 

But in the meantime .. is there anyone that has figured out some kind of pricing arrangement with the providers that doesn't leave them having to nickle and dime consumers?

mfm0ih6,,"For monthly there is 3 players: windsurf (500 cap), cursor (500 fast, unlimited slow), copilot (unlimited but rate limited).

Copilot last year was crap, so lot of people think it’s still is. They have evolved a lot since the last Github Universe. Seems like they changed direction and are implementing that. 

So far for $10 Copilot is the one that you can get the most query even with the rate limit.
$20 for Cursor is not bad if you can deal with a somewhat buggy fork of vs code (they fix, but there is always something broken). Slow query can get very slow/useless

I know there is probably other one, but honestly who cares, tons comes and goes.

1iy5peu,Resolving localhost issues when setting up Supabase CLI via Windsurf + Docker + Claude Sonnet 3.5,"Let me preface this by saying I absolutely love Windsurf, but also wanted to share a resolution (and reflection) in case others come across similar issues.

**Taken from X (25/2/25):**

*Just hit an annoying issue with setting up Supabase CLI locally with Windsurf. Ended up resolving (with the help of Claude Sonnet 3.7) by removing Docker configs.*   
  
*this is where it's helpful to know about this stuff (but learning the hard way can be useful too)*  
  
*Windsurf (with claude 3.5 set) had suggested I setup Docker in order to run Supabase CLI, even though it's not NEEDED (only found this out later). Would've been good if Windsurf gave me an option to choose, but shows how sometimes LLMs can go off on tangents, set things up you don't necessarily need, then screw up a bunch of other things along the way.*  
  
*The reason this was all an issue was because the Docker configs prevented me from running any other locally-hosted app (only saw ""internal server error"") - so was burning tokens like crazy, without getting to the root problem.*   
  
*So by simply sharing what i did the night before, it was then able to help figure out the problem. But without me* ***thinking for myself,*** *never would've gotten to a resolution.*  
  
*What this showed me is how important it still is for humans and machines to WORK TOGETHER - despite all it's power, it can only do so much without our guidance at critical junctures.*  
  
*We still need to be able to think for ourselves.*",2025-02-25 13:00:49,3,2,1.0,WindsurfAI,georgesiosi,True,Reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/WindsurfAI/comments/1iy5peu/resolving_localhost_issues_when_setting_up/
