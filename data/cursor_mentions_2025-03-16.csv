mhdmnnj,,"A calm and sane approach to using Cursor!? A blog post without bad LLM images!? This is the hero we need right now. This is all good advice.

One thing I’d add is to be aware of what model you’re using and its strengths and weaknesses. In my experience, Sonnet 3.5 seems best for coding tasks, 3.7 talks a big game and can do ok but it veers way off course a hell of a lot. O3-mini seems good at architecture planning. It’s a changing space so it’s worth trying to stay current.

I think of Cursor like a very eager midlevel engineer. They know all the tools, all the language syntax, and have big ideas for how to do things but they should be given specific instructions for where to start and how to do things; otherwise, they’re liable to go way off course and not ask questions until they’ve wasted a lot of time.",2025-03-12 06:05:14,0,0,0.0,programming,sickcodebruh420,False,Reddit (r/programming),https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1j9ec05/i_use_cursor_daily_heres_how_i_avoid_the_garbage/mhdmnnj/

1ivnr42,I'm a Product Designer who built a Price Comparison platform frontend in 32 hours with Cursor+Claude,"# Introduction

Hey everyone! 👋 I’ve been working on a **comprehensive shopping experienc**e in the form of a **price comparison** platform called [PricePilot](https://trypricepilot.com/)**.**

**It's been designed** to help shoppers discover products efficiently, compare product information side-by-side, and then help compare prices across multiple retailers. As a solo founder, I wanted to share my journey, the challenges I faced, and the tech stack I used.

***BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER:*** *To be transparent as my post is catching the ire of some users, the total time spent on the frontend is at about* ***\~80hrs or so***. The 32 hours I had added in the post title was seeing how fast I could go live with a basic ecommerce frontend which included a search experience, product listings and details page, and full responsiveness.

# Pain Points That Led to PricePilot

Shopping online should be simple, but:

* Finding the best price often means opening multiple tabs and checking different retailers manually.
* Many comparison sites feel outdated, cluttered, or don’t include key product details and features.
* Many platforms prioritize affiliate revenue over a clean UX

I wanted to build something better—**fast, user-friendly, and helpful.**

# How PricePilot Solves These Issues

✅ **Clear, simple UI** and **lightning-fast search** designed for usability  
✅ **Side-by-side product information comparisons** to help you easily compare the differences in price, ratings, and specifications  
✅ **Side-by-side price comparisons** across multiple retailers so you don't have to find the product on each site

*Note: For the moment, we only show US retailers but plan to expand to Canada and perhaps elsewhere once we get everything figured out for the US audience.*

# Tech Stack

💻 **Frontend**: Vercel + Next.js + Typescript + Tailwind CSS + Typesense (Search)  
🛠 **Backend:** Supabase, Python+Playwright+BS4 for web scraping, Node for getting info from APIs and product feeds

# Would Love Your Thoughts!

I’m actively working on improving **search, filtering, and UX optimizations**. Additionally working on getting many more products for you to shop for. If you’re interested in price comparison tools, I’d love your feedback! 🙌

1j4prw6,My (Hopeful) Cursor Redemption Arc.,"This past week, I posted on this subreddit about a silly problem that didn’t really need to be fixed—but I’m glad I did. Turns out the custom cursor trail I spent hours fiddling with, which I thought was the coolest thing about my website, actually sucked. And boy, did you guys not hold back. But I’m so glad I got grilled on my terrible cursor—it was distracting and overall just not great.

I decided to channel this energy into creating something new. So, I completely scrapped the old code and started from scratch. I created two new iterations, trying to incorporate as much of everyone's feedback as possible.

From this link, you’ll find three videos: one of my original cursor effect, one that’s a bit Stronger with the Ink, little darker and more rugged, and another that’s watercolor-inspired with some nice light diffusion. It would mean the world to me if, once again, you all were kind enough to lay into me and tell me what sucks. I tried to take in all the feedback I received, and any pointers would also be amazing!

mgkujqk,,"IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate for me. Yes, it's expensive, but this is my profession, not my hobby. I would do DIY work around the house with tools from Walmart or Harbor Freight but if I'm framing, I'm rolling with Metabo (or something equally high quality).

I currently use Copilot because Cursor feels like it tries to replace too much of how I actually USE my IDE in the first place. Not to toot my own horn but hey, I've been coding since I was 14 and I'm 49. Imagine knowing a foreign language for almost 40 years. You may not be the best in the world at it but you've still outgrown tools like Duolingo.

I don't ""chat"" with Copilot and ask it to write a function for me. It's not even about the code it generates. It just honestly takes me longer to write the prompts in the precise way needed to get the function done the way I would have just written it myself. I work mostly on business-oriented Web and mobile apps, and usually when their logic gets complex it's because there are more rules, not because you're trying to come up with a yet-more-optimal ed25519 curve generator. Time sheets can't be submitted if they don't have start and end times. Oh, also, they can't be submitted if the job code is inactive. Oh, and don't forget, end time must be > start time. Oh and a shift can't be >20h without human approval. Oh yeah, check to be sure it's not a holiday. You get the idea. Just listing all that in a chat session as precisely as you need to do to get the code to be correct - I could have just written it in a few minutes. I didn't need help with that.

The reason I use it at all is because of REFACTORING. Man, Copilot is insanely useful when it comes to that. Pivoting some nested object of consts into an array to feed something like a form-fields-defaults dropdown... I'll get some spreadsheet from Product, paste it into a comment, then just start typing the first entry of the array in the shape I want them all to be. By the time I'm on the second or third, it's figured out what I'm doing and I can just code-complete to get the rest. A small amount of editing, and a tedious task is now just a TAB key to accept it and done. And there are no prompts to adjust it either. If I don't like what it's suggesting, I just keep adjusting my first few entries and eventually it figures out the right pattern.",2025-03-07 13:23:06,16,0,0.0,webdev,CodeAndBiscuits,False,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1j5z69o/which_ide_do_you_use/mgkujqk/

1jbyxxr,"My brother and I built ""Laravel for JS"" and it just crossed 15,000 stars on GH. Here's the backstory.","Hey webdev,

I still remember the [first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/f47r2e/showoff_saturday_brother_and_i_just_finished/) posting about our project in this community five years ago. We didn't really know what we were doing (still easily applies today) and were getting bashed from left and right, but the feedback we got here was super useful and kept us going.

[Wasp](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) is a full-stack, batteries-included web framework built on top of React, Node.js, and Prisma. It just crossed 15,000 stars [on GitHub](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) and is being used by solopreneurs, startups, and Fortune 500 companies. There are about 4,000 builders in our Discord, and Wasp is currently in Beta.

Here's the story of how we got here and what we learned.

# The beginning - ""What you're building is a holy grail. Everyone before you failed.""



https://preview.redd.it/bbxu7y7ruvoe1.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=14341da2bc4d0396335e92285284d5a01ef9a059

This is what YC told us when we applied for the second time in May 2020. At that point, we had worked on Wasp for 1.5 years, the last nine months full-time. We had quit our previous jobs and gone all in. By this point, we were already fairly drained mentally, physically, and financially. Still, the curiosity of whether we can make this happen was stronger than fear and we decided to give it one last shot.

Today, **Wasp has over 15,000 stars on GitHub**. Developers of all backgrounds have used it to **develop thousands of web apps**, from side projects that have grown into [acquired](https://wasp.sh/blog/2024/09/17/from-idea-to-20k-in-days-how-wasp-accelerated-nuloapps-launch) or [revenue-generating businesses](https://docs.opensaas.sh/blog/2024-12-10-turboreel-os-ai-video-generator-built-with-open-saas/) to venture-backed startups and internal tools deployed within Fortune 500 companies.

[SaaS-es made with Wasp \/ OpenSaaS](https://preview.redd.it/tc7lgu87nvoe1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=10bd3b011fe6c0fab5f962192f06158a53d647c9)

Some people have grown to love Wasp and the vision it pursues. Thanks to them, we enjoy working on it. Without the community that gathered around Wasp (>4,000 devs in our Discord), we wouldn’t have been even close to where we are today.

[Folks saying nice stuff about Wasp \(there's opposite, too\)](https://preview.redd.it/mdu1x6zbovoe1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=56f29493bc6e50301eb629378ccc0a10b7aad344)

# The journey - getting from 0 to 15,000 stars

As with most success stories, the success rarely happens linearly. It usually starts with a long period of ""drought"" with occasional signs of life, and then there is a moment when things click together and start moving really fast. We experienced the same, and it looked something like this:

https://preview.redd.it/32yz0cwkovoe1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9214b159795869ac406048bf43c944c5ce028c4

# The inception - “Why not?”

In the beginning, Wasp was just an idea—or rather, a question: ""*Why hasn't anyone built this yet? What would we discover if we tried?*"" After spending a decade building web apps and using every major tech stack (from PHP to Java and Node.js on the server to Backbone, Angular, and React on the client), we were feeling the pain of ""framework fatigue,"" aka reinventing the wheel with each new stack.

So we set out to start thinking about it and put things on paper (ok, Google Slides). This is how the original idea for Wasp was born - ***can we create a framework that removes a lot of boilerplate by offering higher-level abstractions, but is still flexible enough and is not strictly bound to the specific stack and architecture?***

Now looking at it, it really does sound like a holy grail.

# Getting in YC and things getting real

About nine months in, full-time, we started getting some early traction and received positive feedback from Reddit, Hacker News, and Product Hunt, but we also started realizing how much work is needed to bring a full-stack web framework to a state where it’s usable, especially with the ambitious requirements we set for ourselves.

https://preview.redd.it/r2rn8r04pvoe1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3f992550743a9652bd5c30bf871976a9210767d

Finally, we got into YC the third time we applied for it. They were following our progress for the last year and, having seen the community excitement, decided to take a bet on our crazy idea.

https://preview.redd.it/lt4xhvo6pvoe1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9ef6b2b041adf78ebfd8917cdc99c279d707685

# Beta and beyond - MAGE and OpenSaaS

Looking at the graph, you can spot two key inflection points. The first one happened in July 2023 when we launched [**MAGE**](https://wasp.sh/blog/2023/07/10/gpt-web-app-generator), a GPT SaaS starter that uses Wasp under the hood (you can think of it as one-shot Loveable/Bolt). It was among the first LLM products that could generate a working full-stack web app, bringing many eyes to Wasp.

https://preview.redd.it/r2czohz9pvoe1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dfdfe19b3c0917263d86235504edc183a576574

The second major growth catalyzer came in December 2023 with the launch of [**OpenSaaS**](https://opensaas.sh/), our open-source SaaS starter built on top of Wasp, which now has almost 10,000 stars on GitHub.

We realized that most builders really want to start working on their idea as quickly as possible without picking out and patching together all the different features every SaaS needs - authentication, payments, admin dashboard, sending emails, blog, …

And this is exactly what we provided - **a 100% free & open-source, high-quality, SaaS starter based on React, Node.js, Prisma, and Wasp**. OpenSaaS basically became a “killer app” for Wasp as it attracts developers to try it and realize how helpful the framework is.

[Open SaaS also pairs extremely well with Cursor](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1832194642596508076) \- given Wasp’s robust structure and higher-level primitives, many developers have found it as an ideal combo for getting their SaaS-es from an idea to a production-ready app in a matter of days.

# Language/DSL vs framework - so which one is it?

https://preview.redd.it/kpl3gr31qvoe1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=a74d1c6f3ced173101537305e5f45bf2d96f2edc

As you can see from the examples above, we used to refer to Wasp as a language, DSL - a Domain Specific Language. It was for these reasons that we originally set out to have an abstraction layer that can, in the future, work with any language, library, and architecture.

For this, we needed to introduce our own compiler that would first analyze your app’s specification that you defined via Wasp (e.g., your routes, async jobs, db operations, …), combine it with the “native” code you wrote in React & Node.js, and finally generate a React/Node.js app. That effectively meant we’ve invented our own language, albeit very limited and simple.

**This is how we initially presented Wasp, but we learned that is the wrong way to think about it. Wasp is by its function a web framework, just like Laravel, Rails, or Next.js**. The fact that it uses a compiler under the hood is simply an implementation detail that gives it its superpowers. For example, thanks to this approach, [**we can easily visualize the topology of your whole app**](https://wasp.sh/blog/2024/04/25/first-framework-that-lets-you-visualize-react-node-app-code)**, from database to server and client components**:

https://preview.redd.it/ggjv1bo3qvoe1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=87b8ec16f90c0c93dae544308bd824f735dec137

This still a bit of a party trick now, but it opens space for some interesting tooling features in the future.

# The road to 1.0 and building ""Laravel/Rails for JS""

This is the story of how Wasp came to be where it is today. For more details on the very early days (getting from an idea to the first 1,000 stars), you can check out [this post](https://wasp.sh/blog/2022/09/29/journey-to-1000-gh-stars).

What’s next? After almost five years of building and getting feedback from you, we have a pretty clear picture of what Wasp 1.0 needs to look like and we'll just go for it. Our goal is to do what Laravel did for PHP and Rails did for Ruby - an opinionated full-stack, batteries-included framework which you can deploy anywhere and which also scales as you grow. Obviously, the requirements and expectations for frameworks have changed a lot since Laravel/Rails/Django beginnings, but that kind of productivity and the overall experience is what we're after.

1jbt8sw,Why Are Developers So Resistant to AI?,"I don’t get it. Yesterday, I watched an interview with the Anthropic CEO saying that in the next 12 months, 90% of code will be written by AI. At the same time, Mark Zuckerberg was on Joe Rogan’s podcast, saying Meta will have its first AI software engineer by 2025. And Google has already said 25% of its codebase is AI-generated.

Basically, every big tech leader—Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, all of them—are talking about how AI will completely change software development. And the first real, practical application we’re seeing is AI writing code. It’s already happening with tools like Cursor. If we just look at the rate of improvement, it’s hard to deny that if not in 12 months, then in 2-3 years, most code will be written by AI.

Yet, developers still seem super resistant to this idea. I get that AI won’t replace 100% of coding. We’ll still need engineers to solve problems. But it’s obvious that the number of devs needed per company is going to shrink. If a company has 150 devs today, maybe in a few years, they’ll need only 50 or less.

And this isn’t even coming out of nowhere. We’ve already seen mass layoffs post-Covid. The demand for developers isn’t skyrocketing like before, but the supply is still huge. So why are so many developers acting like AI isn’t a real threat to their jobs? Are they in denial? Or is there something I’m missing?

mhwohpo,,"- CEOs have vested interests in saying that.
- Try using the cursor to create something that is more than an MVP
- Senior engineers who have been in the same for a while don't find AI to be helpful enough.
- Juniors can't distinguish the difference between very good code written by seniors and by AI
- Product managers and CEOs want AI to be doing their stuff.


I certainly love that AI is getting popular. When you'll be creating an app that's 75% of the way there but the last 25% doesn't work no matter what you do and is super buggy, it'll be a goldmine for the devs who actually know their stuff. It's very very good actually, if it becomes a hard market for juniors to enter, most people who only enter the field because of money will go elsewhere. After a few years of stagnation, there will be a high demand for devs who can actually fix the AI written mess, but you won't have enough of them, as most of the new devs will be dependent on AI.

If every 5 years number of devs double, and most juniors rely on AI, in just 10 years we'll have so many mediocre devs who are dependent on AI and aren't different from product manager ( but product managers have MBAs and experience) 

The few devs who are really good will earn huge amounts of money.

So, yeah. It's bad for a majority of devs because they're mediocre. It's good for a small amount of devs who are actually good.

Problem is that a large amount of mediocre devs think that they're good.",2025-03-15 04:54:22,2,0,0.0,webdev,Varun77777,False,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1jbt8sw/why_are_developers_so_resistant_to_ai/mhwohpo/

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)

Put your JS is below the HTML and/or uses a load event to prevent the JS running before the DOM is ready:

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load\_event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event)

Mind you, that using the load event will replace any other JS that defines a load event. You can't have two \`window.onload = (event) => {}\` because the previous one will be replaced.

Also, if you are using an element that isn't a button, it will not display the correct cursor to hint to the viewer that it is clickable. You can specify this in the CSS:

1j0jtey,Took your feedback and made changes to my website!,"Thanks a lot guys for the feedback in the last post ! There were a couple of issues which resonated with the masses and I took them on positive note. Common feedback included :  
1) scrolling being messy  
2) Lack of Nav bar which made it frustrating  
3) too much animation hence unusable  
4) broken subdomains   
5) few buttons being unresponsive   
so I fixed all the above mentioned concerns . Open to more improvement ! Do check out the website again!

[vaibhavdoes.tech](http://vaibhavdoes.tech) 

Edit 1: 
6)made the light flickering in the nav bar smoother.
7)removed the unnecessary back to home link on one of the pages
8) made the light following cursor affect more robust on the tiles of about page

Edit 2:
9) Fixed the isue where no visual indicator appeared for the active nav bar item if tab key was used for navigation",2025-02-28 14:12:12,7,12,0.82,webdev,varun-saha,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1j0jtey/took_your_feedback_and_made_changes_to_my_website/

1j9eqnq,IDE / Editor themes. What's good?,"I currently use Vscode / Cursor. And for it, I use the one dark colour theme from. The extensions store that replicated the old pallette from Atom. In my opinion this looked amazing, and has worked for me for a long time. 

I recent times, I've been looking to try different code editors just to try them out. Jetbrains, even nvim. 

But I've noticed that across these other editors, my favourite theme is no-where to be found. And I was quite surprised by how much effect your colour scheme has on your ability to quickly parse and find code.

Are there a collection of big name colour schemes that have lots of integrations? Not even just with code editors but maybe the terminal itself? I love a unified look, and that's the solution I'm going for.

1ispimw,Help would be appreciate: hitting some roadblocks in building an app,"Hi all!  I wanted to gain some insight from the minds in this sub.  To start out, I wanted to tell you all that I am not a technical mind. I have done any technical work in the past.  My background is 25+ years in sales, biz dev, marketing, CS, etc.  

However, in the last week or so I've attempted to build an app by using Cursor AI and other AI tools.  But I'm beginning to hit a roadblock with connecting databases/the back end to the front end. 

First question: what's the best way for me to learn how to approach these issues?  Which AI tool is best to guide me through these barriers?

Second question: if I am unable to complete this myself, what's the best way to source efficient work for a web app?  this would be a B2B web app in a focused industry primarily targeting sales and customer facing professionals.

## Things to considerate:
1. Both the index.html and store.html links only script.js

2. opening the store.html and refreshing it 2-3 times gives this console error:
```txt
Error: Error fetching data: 
TypeError {}
message: ""Failed to fetch""
stack: ""TypeError: Failed to fetch↵ at window.fetch (http://localhost:8158/mguxb9xw_console.js:8:221620)↵ at fetchData (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:13:28)↵ at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:21:9)↵ at http://localhost:8158/script.js:4:1""
get stack: ƒ ()
set stack: ƒ ()
[[Prototype]]: Object
```
3. Open store.html and adding items in store.html and when I refresh the page 2-3 times it gives this error: and I cant add any items after that
```txt
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
at http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:55:25
at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
at renderCartItems (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:47:16)
at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:22:3)
```
4. Clearing the localStorage and trying does not solve any problem

5. I threw both my code and errors at AI tools for help, but instead of fixing the bug, we both ended up more confused—now it feels like the AI is debugging me!

1j6d84j,Best AI for Programming (2025-03),"Hey all, I've been using free-tier AI tools pretty intensively over the past few months to support my work and daily life. About 70% of my usage is for programming, and the rest is for other stuff. I’ve been jumping between tools like ChatGPT, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Deepseek—mostly because one of them is usually down or hits its limit when I need it.

Recently, I discovered Lovable dev (along with similar options like Bolt and v0) and gave it a try—pretty impressive stuff 😅. Now I'm feeling a bit stuck on which one is really worth upgrading to a paid subscription.

Any thoughts or suggestions? Also, if anyone’s got a setup that mixes two or more free AIs or even self-hosting options (whether on your own hardware or a rented server), I'm all ears.

For context, I'm a fullstack developer. Thanks in advance!",2025-03-08 00:59:40,0,2,0.14,webdev,matchalixious,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1j6d84j/best_ai_for_programming_202503/

I don't mean an AI assistant inside an IDE, but let's say you're making an extension for reddit; so you'd browse to [reddit.com](http://reddit.com) and tell the AI tool to write you JS mutation observer function that hides all the comments below a certain threshold. Just an example.

  
Copilot in Edge can't see the page apparently.

If that's not currently possible, how about you give it an url and it visits the page to ""look"" at it.

1itinty,Loading screen question,"I got a working loading that is almost to my personal favorite. I just need to change the cursor color to gold. And the ring colors around. But I was wondering what should I do about the amount of times it shows up.

I currently have it so that it loads every time a user goes to the homepage. It's great. And I want to add a purposeful delay. Like make the screen 3 seconds long for the whole thing to work. And since the ring is already pulsing, make the text under it do the same.

But I was wondering if I should only have it once when someone goes into the website for the first time or should I just keep it so ita will always show up whenever a user goes to the homepage from any tab in my website?

Addition: I am just making a portfolio/personal website. I'm making this becuase there a few elements in the script takes maybe a second or two. I am adjusting the loading to be quick. And I have a fading animation for when the loading is done.

I do want to add in something in the beginning. But It would be horrible to make someone click an extra step every  time they want to go home.",2025-02-19 14:30:24,1,2,1.0,webdev,mobilefreak_lee,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1itinty/loading_screen_question/
1j56ju8,I Built a Footnotes Plugin for Summernote – Looking for Feedback!,"Hey r/webdev,

I recently built and published a **Footnotes plugin** for the **Summernote WYSIWYG editor**, and I’d love to get your thoughts on it! 🎉

🔹 **What It Does:**

* Lets you insert **footnotes** at the cursor position.
* Automatically adds them to the end of the editor’s content.

🔹 **Why I Built It:**  
I noticed that Summernote doesn’t have a built-in footnotes feature, and manually handling footnotes can be frustrating, especially for blogs, academic content, or articles. So, I decided to create a plugin to solve this problem.

🔹 **Check it out here:**  
👉 **GitHub:** [https://github.com/ahmadyousefdev/summernote-footnotes](https://github.com/ahmadyousefdev/summernote-footnotes)

1j0bvk2,AI Code Assistant Demos,"I think tools like Cursor and Copilot are nice. They haven’t been useful or reliable enough to revolutionize my workflow, but they certainly keep me from bouncing around Stack Overflow.

I just find the messaging around these tools to be a little bizarre. There is almost a late night infomercial vibe to it all. 

“Throw all your knives away! You only need this one!”

I saw a post by someone who works at a VP level raving over a demo where someone cloned an app using some AI tool. He then trash talked the “old school” way of building software with scrum teams and dozens of devs.

It was very disappointing, and alarming to see a post like that, because I feel he should know better. Imagine working as a welder, and your boss walks in and says, “I saw a commercial where this guy put an entire boat together using this stuff called Flex Seal. All he had to do was spray it on. I want all this old school welding equipment out of here.”

I wish the messaging around these tools would change. Because they are good tools, and they deserve better than “For only $19.99, you can build an app in minutes!”

1j9196v,"I didn't want to go, but PyCharm finally drove me into the arms of VSCode, after 5+ years.","I just switched to VSCode after well over five years with PyCharm. I didn't want to do it, but I just can't stand it anymore.

**Things I love about PyCharm and will miss**

1. The refactoring functionality. VSCode's Python extension has that too, but it isn't as nice. 

At this point, that's pretty much it.

**Things that drove me nuts**

1. IdeaVim. It actually got better recently, but for years and years, the undo function was busted, so you had to hit `u` over and over to undo what in real vim is a single operation. VSCode's neovim plugin uses actual neovim under the hood, which is obviously so much more robust and faithful, while IdeaVim will never be a full implementation.
2. The gradual accumulation of simple bugs that never get fixed.
3. It's so slow. I didn't appreciate just how slow until I switched over to VSCode. I mean, holy crap, it's 10x faster for a lot of things (opening a project, installing or restarting extensions, for example).

Here are the bugs that have bugged me the worst:

The ""usages"" window (cmd-click on a definition, see where it's used) constantly resizes itself too small. It's been a problem for years. They won't fix the way autosize works, OR let us turn it off. Plus you have to get your mouse cursor nearly pixel-perfect to resize it yourself, so you can see the whole code preview. Then the very next time you use it, it's back to its stupidly narrow size.

**Type inference is busted.** 

If you do something as standard as this, you get a type error on `f`, saying ""Expected type 'SupportsWrite[bytes]', got 'BufferedWriter' instead"":

    with open(filename, ""wb"") as f:
        pickle.dump(obj, f)

And I can't just disable the ""unexpected type"" code inspection--it's probably the single most valuable one. So I'm stuck with a lot of my files showing warnings that shouldn't be there. Which also keeps me from using the keyboard shortcut to bounce to any real problem of a lower severity.

If you're doing a comprehension inside a class method, and you name the iteration variable the same as a class attribute (e.g., you have `myclass.name`, and you do a comprehension like `[ ... for name in names]`, then the inferred type of the iteration variable overwrites the inferred type of the class attribute. This makes no sense--`name` and `self.name` have nothing to do with one another. This one is easy enough to work around by appending an underscore to the iteration variable's name, but it indicates something is very wrong under the hood.

There are several more specific type inference problems in my codebase, where my method clearly returns `MyType`, but PyCharm infers it as `MyType | None` and throws a warning. The method cannot possibly return `None`, and `mypy` agrees with me. So I'm stuck with another spurious warning.

These problems just never, ever get fixed, and they keep on accruing. Add it to the fact that JetBrains IDE's are always second in line for addon support, and I just couldn't justify sticking with it.

Thanks for coming to my talk, sorry I went over time.

**Edit:** I thought of something else I like better about PyCharm: the diff view. It's a lot nicer than VSCode's, which looks more like the actual output of `diff`.",2025-03-11 13:50:04,513,212,0.9,Python,JUSTICE_SALTIE,True,Reddit (r/Python),https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1j9196v/i_didnt_want_to_go_but_pycharm_finally_drove_me/
mhevdgz,,"I use both (actually, PyCharm Pro and Cursor) because I'm on the fence.

PyCharm does drive me crazy with their updates tho. It can't even properly clean up a previous version of itself. So I'm stuck with three separate folders in AppData/Program Files, and removing the previous one once broke my entire install to the point where I had to manually clean my registry and reinstall the whole thing from scratch. Not to mention how infuriating it is when I run it on my less frequently used laptop, get prompted to update to a new version, do so, it downloads a surprisingly heavy update, tells me to relaunch, I do, open it up again, get prompted to update plugins, I accept, version conflicts arise, resolve these, it tells me to relaunch, I do, open it up once again, and... I get another prompt to upgrade to a new version! It's absolutely ridiculous.

Settings sync across Win/Mac is also just a buggy mess altogether.

> i really don't understand why wouldnt just adapt to modern keyboard shortcuts.

It's not about the keyboard shortcuts. Most of them don't even change if you use vim mode instead of standard editing--only the very few that conflict with a standard vim keystroke like ctrl-R for redo.

**You're not giving up any of the IDE's features whatsoever--they all remain available to you, and almost all of them remain relevant. Vim mode just changes the way you interact with the code while editing.**

It's not about renaming variables, either. I'd never do that with a vim command when the IDE will do it for me as needed in all files, and knows *not* to do it when the same name is used in different contexts.

It's just that once you get comfortable with it, it's *fluid* in a way that's hard to describe. For instance, if I've got six lines of code that I want to move up by twelve lines. With standard editing, I'd have to grab the mouse, or do a bunch of arrow-shift-arrow stuff. 

But in vim mode, it'll be something like `d6j12kp`. (And no, you don't have to count the lines--that's what ""relative line numbering"" is for!) Just moving around is better. If you want to go up 30 lines to do something, you don't grab the mouse or reach for an arrow key and hold it down, you just say `30k` and you're there. You're probably thinking about your next edit on the way, maybe even typing it without a pause. It's like a little language. It's efficient, and it's *fun*.

If I want to change a list comprehension to a set comprehension, then it's just `cs]}` with my cursor anywhere inside the comprehension. Enclose the rest of a line inside a function call, e.g., `var = foo` to `var = str(foo)`? It's `ys$fstr<enter>`. Now, that's not better than `str(`<end>`)`, but...

*Any* editing operation you've just done can be repeated with the `.` key. So if I've been doing that thing with `str(foo)` and I need to do it a few more times, it's probably just `n.n.n.` (next match, repeat command).

 I'm not saying those commands are intuitive if you're new to it, because they aren't. But imagine if it *was* second nature, how fast and comfortable it would be, to do everything so quickly without ever taking your fingers off the home row.

1jbv74v,Unvibe: Generate code that passes Unit-Tests,"    # What My Project Does
    Unvibe is a Python library to generate Python code that passes Unit-tests. 
    It works like a classic `unittest` Test Runner, but it searches (via Monte Carlo Tree Search) 
    a valid implementation that passes user-defined Unit-Tests. 
    
    # Target Audience (e.g., Is it meant for production, just a toy project, etc.)
    Software developers working on large projects
    
    # Comparison (A brief comparison explaining how it differs from existing alternatives.)
    It's a way to go beyond vibe coding for professional programmers dealing with large code bases.
    It's an alternative to using Cursor or Devon, which are more suited for generating quick prototypes.
    
    
    
    ## A different way to generate code with LLMs
    
    In my daily work as consultant, I'm often dealing with large pre-exising code bases.
    
    I use GitHub Copilot a lot.
    It's now basically indispensable, but I use it mostly for generating boilerplate code, or figuring out how to use a library.
    As the code gets more logically nested though, Copilot crumbles under the weight of complexity. It doesn't know how things should fit together in the project.
    
    Other AI tools like Cursor or Devon, are pretty good at generating quickly working prototypes,
    but they are not great at dealing with large existing codebases, and they have a very low success rate for my kind of daily work.
    You find yourself in an endless loop of prompt tweaking, and at that point, I'd rather write the code myself with
    the occasional help of Copilot.
    
    Professional coders know what code they want, we can define it with unit-tests, **we don't want to endlessly tweak the prompt.
    Also, we want it to work in the larger context of the project, not just in isolation.**
    In this article I am going to introduce a pretty new approach (at least in literature), and a Python library that implements it:
    a tool that generates code **from** unit-tests.
    
    **My basic intuition was this: shouldn't we be able to drastically speed up the generation of valid programs, while
    ensuring correctness, by using unit-tests as reward function for a search in the space of possible programs?**
    I looked in the academic literature, it's not new: it's reminiscent of the
    approach used in DeepMind FunSearch, AlphaProof, AlphaGeometry and other experiments like TiCoder: see [Research Chapter](
    #research
    ) for pointers to relevant papers.
    Writing correct code is akin to solving a mathematical theorem. We are basically proving a theorem
    using Python unit-tests instead of Lean or Coq as an evaluator.
    
    For people that are not familiar with Test-Driven development, read here about [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
    and [Unit-Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing).
    

    ## How it works
    
    I've implemented this idea in a Python library called Unvibe. It implements a variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search
    that invokes an LLM to generate code for the functions and classes in your code that you have
    decorated with `@ai`.
    
    Unvibe supports most of the popular LLMs: Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek.
    
    Unvibe uses the LLM to generate a few alternatives, and runs your unit-tests as a test runner (like `pytest` or `unittest`).
    **It then feeds back the errors returned by failing unit-test to the LLMs, in a loop that maximizes the number
    of unit-test assertions passed**. This is done in a sort of tree search, that tries to balance
    exploitation and exploration.
    
    As explained in the DeepMind FunSearch paper, having a rich score function is key for the success of the approach:
    You can define your tests by inherting the usual `unittests.TestCase` class, but if you use `unvibe.TestCase` instead
    you get a more precise scoring function (basically we count up the number of assertions passed rather than just the number
    of tests passed).
    
    It turns out that this approach works very well in practice, even in large existing code bases,
    provided that the project is decently unit-tested. This is now part of my daily workflow:
    
    1. Use Copilot to generate boilerplate code
    
    2. Define the complicated functions/classes I know Copilot can't handle
    
    3. Define unit-tests for those complicated functions/classes (quick-typing with GitHub Copilot)
    
    4. Use Unvibe to generate valid code that pass those unit-tests
    
    It also happens quite often that Unvibe find solutions that pass most of the tests but not 100%: 
    often it turns out some of my unit-tests were misconceived, and it helps figure out what I really wanted.

Myself, and all of my coworkers who have more than a few years of experience have pretty much the same opinion on AI: it’s just not that good. 

It is faster 99% of the time to just roll up our sleeves and write the code ourselves. 

Does the llm generate code, sometimes even perfectly working code? Of course. This is especially true for very small and well-defined problem spaces. 

Most professional codebases that have been around for even a few months are neither of these things. 

The LLM, even flavors that have the ability to analyze the entire codebase like ides such as cursor can, just cannot hold enough context about the codebase to provide useful results. 

When I was piloting cursor for our company I spent more time reviewing and fixing the code it generated than if I had simply implemented features myself. 

This brings me to my second point: people who are just getting started programming should NOT be using these tools to generate their code. They do not possess the experience to adequately review the generated code.  

This goes double for people who have NO experience programming and think Claude will make them a software engineer.

mgpcmtt,,"Happy to see a post like this, I've been curious about the landscape for new developers at jobs where ai is encouraged.

>This thing made me feel like I know nothing. It makes all my effort seem worthless it codes faster than me it looks better and it can optimize it's own code.

Does a calculator make you feel inadequate with its math knowledge and effortless computation speed? The answer to both should be yes. But that's fine, your job isn't to memorize and write the best code, your job is to do your job. Instead of an entry level code monkey, you're now a junior architect who is giving instructions to an ai code monkey, congratulations!

My advice is to get good at reading code and giving feedback. You don't want to let ai make any decisions on its own, that's how you get bad or even dangerous results. It might appear to perfectly understand simple problem domains but when it comes to solving business problems it might make an assumption that is the opposite of what you need or includes a fatal miscalculation. A good way to ensure the ai doesn't make too many decisions is to write or request that it writes stubs/signatures only and then put comments in the function body to precisely guide what it will create.

I shill it so much I feel like I should be paid to do so, but I'd also like to mention windsurf. If your company is already set with a dozen licenses or enterprise setup for cursor then so be it, but I enjoyed windsurf as an alternative for an ai integrated ide that can be instructed to code. I don't know what it does better or worse than cursor, but it's good to know what your options are.

Edit: oops, forgot to answer the question. Why learn? If it's your passion to compete with the calculator then keep practicing and you will get better. You need to think deep and ask yourself - what do you actually want? What is more important to you, being able to build a thing without the ai or that the thing gets built?

mgpkwka,,"I believe we’re at an inflection point where the contrast between a CS undergrad’s education and the real work world is going to require an overhaul of that curriculum. I was lucky enough to go to a school that was focused on getting into the industry from a non-programming field. 

I’m here with a Data Science education. Instead of learning machine learning from the fundamentals of sigma algebra (ie most DS programs), we learned:

1. ML/Deep Learning techniques
2. Workflows for efficiently deploying and evaluating models
3. Spark/Distributed ETL on data collected for a Fitbit use case
4. Creating an ML-centric application requiring the use of Jira/Github, deployed to the cloud and pitched to venture capitalists.

All to say that while you do need to know how to program to be a programmer, the experience comes from recognizing solutions and implementing them in a sane way.

\* There and thousands of things going in the world and you don't need to focus on everything, just focus on what matters for you, learn what matters for you. If you are learning Web-Dev then keep 90% focus on that only and 10% on other fields just for the sake of knowledge.

\*Also keep the knowledge of cloud computing because companies are asking the basic knowledge of cloud computing.

\*It is true that AI is coming and It will kill mediocre coders , so I will suggest to learn AI also in your free time because after 5-10 years later there will soo many job opening for AI jobs.

  
Hope that helps,

The second issue is that there _is_ a purpose to learning how to get information yourself. You do often need to read docs to do things, since stuff gets updated, and Google and stackoverflow force you to look at the issue you're having, understand it, and then finding (and understanding) the solution. 

With Cursor, you neither know what the problem is, why it happened (after all, these agents are prone to random mistakes), or how you can prevent it from happening again.

On one hand, it's nice to be able to tell a junior or an intern to ""just use an LLM to do it"", but the purpose of being a junior is to _learn_.

How do you know when the LLM makes mistakes? Well it’s when their generated code fails the tests they themselves made based off project specs. 

I’ve gone through exercises where I will encourage juniors to actually come up with questions about their generated code. If you’re hellbent on them learning, why don’t you turn your “I fill your mind’s cup” into reviewing generated code so that you can discuss the common pitfalls. 

As I’m in AI space, my discussions in code review go both towards “this is what to look for in badly generated code” followed by “what are you prompting and how can we improve that to get the results we do want?” This usually ends up in some great discussions and packages that can be researched and then indexed for the prompt to reference. 

Then it’s my job as architect to assign tickets atomic enough to be easily generated/tweaked and potentially don’t introduce too many dependencies. 

I’m still thoroughly convinced that AI is just exposing our inefficiencies in planning, implementation, mentorship, education, etc… ride the wave or not, but even that “outdated docs” problem has already been solved with knowledge graphs on api/sdk/library documentation.

And when I first saw these tools I was really excited to use these tools because in my previous attempt at learning programming, one of the main reasons why I stopped was because writing syntax for logic I knew how to build just tired me out. 

But when I started using github copilot, it didn't really seem like ""cheating"" To me because I view programming as more of building logic rather than learning syntax. 
But still, I am pretty new to programming, so I would be open to new opinions on this matter.

I'm using Cursor with some MCP tools like Github, Supabase, Sequential Thinking, BrowserTools, and it's really helping me a lot.  
Here is some of the steps to install the Github MCP tool on Cursor:

Step 1: Go to Cursor Settings > MCP  
Step 2: Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (Settings > Developer Settings > Tokens)  
Step 3: Go to [Smithery GitHub MCP Tool](https://smithery.ai/server/@smithery-ai/github), click Cursor, paste your GitHub token, and copy the generated command  
Step 4: Go back to Cursor Settings > MCP, click Add New MCP Server  
Step 5: Give it a name (e.g., GitHub MCP), set type to Command, and paste the command  
Step 6: Click Refresh MCP GitHub Tool is now installed

1ird6g1,Experiencing Algorithms Skill Issues and Not Sure How To Get Good,"Please let me know if there is a diff subreddit I should post this in!

First things first: I am in my first intro to algos class and after looking at my grades... I am doomed. I am fundamentally missing something and cannot figure out for the life of me why I am so pathetically bad at this.

For one, I have like a decent amount of experience programming; I've done a handful of beginner projects, and generally feel like I can explain fundamental concepts (abstraction/classes/etc) decently enough, but when I go to code this intense sense of dread and stupidity washes over me and I feel immense pain, frustration, and self hatred every time I do it.

Now, in this course, this sense of frustration and impatience has just officially hit its peak. I am missing pretty much every deadline because I procrastinate so much, and when I do hit the deadlines, I either don't recurse enough times in something or I am using dynamic arrays when they want me to use static arrays, etc. and I am just losing it. While I understand procrastination does not help, there is nothing I would rather avoid than doing a CS project while in the midst of my other more interesting EE-focused classes, and I also just like. Hate it.

One great example is this palindrome detector I'm trying to build. I know in and out how this problem should go, the whole vector of vectors structure I want to use, what my recursive functions are going to do, what their base cases should be, what helper functions I need, what edge cases I want to check for, and yet here I sit, gazing on my VSCode terminal with a completely blank .cpp file and my cursor blinking at me menacingly. Like everything is there in my head but actually putting it down I have so many things I need to start I don't even know where to begin.

In the past, I've tried writing pseudocode, and that helps a little, but I always end up with a pile of awful horrible bugs that make me feel incredibly discouraged, and I've tried starting with smaller functions, but I always find myself going back and forth from unit tests and getting so caught up in writing test cases that the actual code part itself is the last thing I want to do when I've adequately created 1-2 working functions.

It also hurts that in lecture, etc a lot of these concepts download pretty quickly and feel digestible. I really like conceptually concocting solutions to problems and feel comfortable explaining and figuring out where specific data structures are most optimal. Not a single \*written\* assignment has been difficult for me, it is literally just programming.

Now that I'm done whining, here come the questions: how do I overcome this skill issue? Is there a particular resource that will help me build my programming muscle, and if so, is that what is fundamentally missing here? I've heard LeetCode is pretty good, but nobody I talk to can really speak to its value as they haven't really needed it (they just good like that I guess). I'm considering trying it out because in other problem-solving/design-oriented classes, I largely benefit from doing a massive volume of practice problems, but if there is a resource that is better, I would love some insight. Additionally, how do I avoid the testing trap where I find myself just focusing on writing test cases and neglect the actual progress I'm trying to make?

I am still safe to pass if I make a drastic enough change and really refocus my energy, but I need to get on that ASAP if I want to actually do decently well in the course. Any and all advice will be cherished and valued immensely.",2025-02-16 22:04:49,17,8,0.88,learnprogramming,janky-squirrel98,True,Reddit (r/learnprogramming),https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ird6g1/experiencing_algorithms_skill_issues_and_not_sure/

Are you maybe overcomplicating it?

I don't think you need all this stuff for palindrome detection, do you? (Unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean by that...)

1j7c5qa,Software engineer who is bad at planning,"I’m a software engineer who is bad at planning. 

Ways in which this affects me:
- Writing design docs bores me. I would rather prototype and learn as I do. Though I do see benefit of designing to ensure requirements are clear, evaluate trade-offs, and prevent wasted efforts / inefficient solutions. I see the benefit. I just don’t enjoy writing them as much. I like to do. 
- It’s difficult for me to estimate the ETA of a task. I’d rather just work on two important tasks in parallel and try to finish both as quickly as possible. When I am blocked on one, I work on the other. 
- And I’m worried that Cursor/Copilot AI is going to automate me, and I don’t really have any career plan here when that happens. 


Can anyone relate? Does anyone have any advice?

1jaygyy,Learn JavaScript or soon obsolete with AI tools?,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently exploring startup ideas, mainly around web applications, and I have a big question about learning to code.

With the rise of platforms like Lovable, Bolt, Cursor, and Supabase, which speed up MVP development using vibe coding, is it still worth spending months learning JavaScript?

Honestly, I don’t want to invest 3–4 months learning it only to realize that in 6 months or a year, my skills are already outdated because these tools make development much faster, even for non-advanced coders. Is JavaScript still a valuable asset in this context, or should I focus on Python instead (especially for AI and back-end development)?

I also feel like AI integration has become almost mandatory for standing out in today’s startup world. For those who have launched a project, do you think it’s essential, or can a well-designed product still succeed without AI?

Lastly, if any of you have built a startup without technical skills or a network of developers, I’d love to hear your experience. How did you overcome that challenge?

1iyxrkh,Help for school project,"
Hello,
I'm supposed to make a game in windows forms and I chose a top down shooter. I created a script to rotate a weapon around the player depending on where the mouse cursor is but now I need to rotate the weapon around itself so it always faces the curser. I realized how hard this is to do in windows forms but maybe any of you has an idea how to do it. Please if someone knows if this is possible in windows forms please tell me how. Thanks",2025-02-26 12:44:33,1,2,0.66,learnprogramming,Lara372007,True,Reddit (r/learnprogramming),https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1iyxrkh/help_for_school_project/
1j92dpo,Can't remove bottom white space on horizontally sliding sections.,"Hello,

I've been scratching my head with this one for a bit - I am also not good at programming. I'm trying to create a portfolio website and I have a gallery on one of the pages. I have a fixed header with navigation elements in them that 'slide' horizontally between certain galleries on said page, they are: ""all"", ""macro"", ""marine"", and ""birdlife"".

  
I have four galleries but I'm focusing on ""all"" and ""macro"" for now. The problem is that ""all"" has more images in its gallery so it makes the page a lot longer - which creates a lot of white space under ""macro"". I have been trying to find a way to reduce this white space but I'm a bit stumped.

  
'Margin' and 'padding' don't work and neither do 'max-height'/'min-height'. I'm a bit worried that there isn't a solution as I realise all of these galleries are on the same page and thus have the same height no matter what.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I understand arrows have special functionality in terminals, to go back to the previous entry, etc.

1ize0ag,Best free alternative of Cursor in VSC with local setup with LM Studio,"Hi,

I would like your opinion on which tool to use to replace Cursor. I like how Cursor works, but I don't want to pay to access all the available features. I have a PC on which I run LM Studio with a Deepseek or Qwen model and I would like to use this instead of the online models via API, so I don't pay for the use because I run it locally. 

I would like to use VSC with some plugin that can connect to my machine with LM Studio and that can replicate the same functions as Cursor. For the functions I would like to have both the suggestions and the autocompletion, but above all the Composer (that function that allows me to create things from scratch starting from a description given in the chat).

Basically, I would like all the Cursor functions, only through free plugins in VSC. Is this possible?

1j3v1zi,I built a Cursor extension that actually REMEMBERS your codebase (because I'm tired of Cursor breaking my codebase every damn time),"Hey fellow devs,

After weeks of wanting to break my computer when Cursor kept breaking my code, I finally snapped and built something.

**The frustration we all know:**

* Explaining your project structure over and over and OVER again
* AI forgetting which libraries you're using after 3 messages
* Getting suggestions that completely ignore your architecture
* That sinking feeling when you realize the ""helpful"" AI just created 47 new bugs

**What I built:** A Cursor extension that creates and maintains a ""project brain"" - it's like giving AI a permanent memory of your codebase's context, architecture, and dev rules.

It works by:

* Creating a detailed spec file of your project's architecture decisions
* Maintaining awareness of file relationships and dependencies
* Actually understanding your tech stack choices (not just guessing)
* Auto-updating as your codebase evolves

**Early users report:**

* AI suggestions that actually make sense for their projects
* No more repeatedly explaining project structure
* Massive reduction in ""AI broke my code"" incidents

Drop a comment or DM if interested! And tell me - what's your biggest frustration with current AI coding tools?",2025-03-04 20:37:07,228,375,0.74,cursor,namanyayg,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j3v1zi/i_built_a_cursor_extension_that_actually/

mg3zkjy,,"This is like creating md files, with specific instructions  
For Example,  
You create [ProjectStructure.md](http://ProjectStructure.md) , [Objectives.md](http://Objectives.md), [Guidelines.md](http://Guidelines.md), [Coding.md](http://Coding.md), [Frontend.md](http://Frontend.md), [backend.md](http://backend.md), [check.md](http://check.md)

You will mainly use [check.md](http://check.md)  
in there  
""ALWAYS"" means -> checking each content of every md file in detail without missing out any content

then say   
Always check  [ProjectStructure.md](http://ProjectStructure.md) , before creating any new file, and also update it before implementing the last file during composing.

Always use [Frontend.md](http://Frontend.md), if you are creating and detected editing a front end file.

Always use, check, and update [Objectives.md](http://Objectives.md) once implementing current and the next steps.  
........  
and this goes on ...............  
  
the good thing about this, is that you could create your own custom instructions based on the project, once you already used this once in the project, although it might not work at first, but you could improve it based on your own requirements  
  
for example, i had [Error.md](http://Error.md) file, i told cursor to always add linter errors, or any other errors that i paste for it solve in the  [Error.md](http://Error.md) file and how it solved it, it did not automatically add until i had to mention about it, or you could even write a run a script, for this.

I think memory is already there, its just based on instructions to add to train in more based on a user's requirement, because other's do not even need rules because of the way the do the prompting, which is very important, the way you word it makes a big difference, not just normal English.

Maybe you could create an Extension to install in Cursor about logging and learning from this Errors, like whatever the project you could use that log  
for example it would usually   
\-sometimes install uncompatible dependencies.  
\-keep { } in import statements that do not need.  
\-Typescript coding style errors,

So you could accumulate this, tell cursor to always check this log before implementing files, so that it could learn, I am sure this will reduce the struggles. 

Maybe another once would implementation style  
For example  
\-It implements modules that have not been installed yet, whereby it should first install all necessary modules then implement the files  
  
\-sometimes it suggests to use a library but that library does not support certain implementation style or variable, which causes alot of errors, whereby it should first check the requirement of your project, then check a library to is flexible supports our implementation requirements. 

Although some might argue that they still create completed projects without any of the above, but it would still better for a user to have there personal memory that there own cursor could use during implementations.  
  
  
Maybe there might be someone has created, but i dont think if its 100% functional meaning that cursor always uses and follows it during the implementations, i think some it might be there but cursor does not fetch it sometimes, and just goes based on its own LLM implementations, And we cant force it follow the memory but use, learn then implement, which should be done.",2025-03-04 23:12:41,3,0,0.0,cursor,[deleted],False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j3v1zi/i_built_a_cursor_extension_that_actually/mg3zkjy/

      - Make sure that components work together with expected ins/outs
      - When creating a models for parsing json, look up the api response or sample code or the sdk documentation directly, and use that as a reference, do not guess.
      - Before creating a class or a file, perform a search on the codebase, and check the memlog/directory_tree for any previous implementations and utilize those.  Never create unnecessary duplicate files.

1j43hka,What are the best alternatives to Cursor?,"Since the latest update Cursor has become unusable. The model ignores rules. It forgets instructions after the first couple edits. It refuses to read files when instructed and will even lie claiming it carefully read and checked something it didn't. It will make edits that are completely non-sensical in context. It will make edits you didn't ask for. edit: I should add that this is not limited to 3.7. It's worse on 3.7 but it happens on 3.5 as well. Something definitely changed that's causing these problems.

I'm guessing this all probably stems from Cursor aggressively cutting down context in an attempt to save costs. I doubt the $20/mo price point is enough to cover the model costs if providing the context the user actually wants to provide. It seems like Cursor is attempting to summarize or cut down context to a bare minimum which leads to all the problems listed above.

At some point, the end user would feel ""Hmmm. This is not really a Big Mac anymore, is it?""

1j7pnoo,Karpathy completely changed the way I use Cursor,"I’ve been coding for years, but I never realized how much time I wasted typing until I stumbled on a video of Andrej Karpathy coding entirely with his voice. I thought it was just a gimmick. But turns out, dictating prompts for Cursor works super well and a lot faster than typing.

It lets me articulate longer prompts without breaking flow and it’s easier describing logical flows. Apparently 3x faster on average compared to typing. For example, dictating a complex API query prompt now takes seconds of braindumping with my voice instead of minutes.

I made a review of all the tools I’ve tested so y’all don’t have to waste money like I did:

Apple Dictation

* Pros: Free and built into macOS.
* Cons: Doesn’t get any technical terms right and ignores punctuation. Fine for a short message, useless for actual accuracy. It also breaks my flow waiting for the words to load in.

Willow Voice

* Pros: Formats paragraphs, adds punctuation intuitively, and handles my filler words. Accuracy and latency are very good.
* Cons: Subscription model, so whatever I pay for it

Aiko

* Pros: Offline and based locally so that I can trust it.
* Cons: No auto-formatting. Latency isn’t as good as other AI tools. My Mac’s fans sound like a jet engine during long sessions.

Dragon NaturallySpeaking

* Pros: Pretty much just legacy at this point
* Cons: It’s abandoned on Mac. Buggy, expensive, and stuck in 2010. Can’t believe I paid hundreds to try this.

Anyone else tried voice coding? Curious if others have workflows or tool tips to share.

For the default modes, you can select and create custom modes that become the default based on the context. For instance when I'm dictating into cursor I have a custom mode with custom prompt around reformatting whatever I say into step by step technical instructions. Then superwhisper converts it to text, sends that to claude with my custom prompt and it comes out way better than the bs I said. Same thing for emails, if superwhisper detects I'm in [mail.google.com](http://mail.google.com) in chrome, the email mode turns on and it reformats it into a full casual formatted email.

A question then becomes is it the user, the cursor software, the algorithms, some misalignment of how the cursor rules should behave or just the model itself. You can hopefully see how communicate the obvious may assist users understand how things are intended to work. So let's say you guys change in the next update how cursorrules work but you don't update the documentation we'll then this causes confusion and communication struggles. My suggestion is to have a well structured and throughout documentation page that can change depending on the version of cursor the user is using.

1iz2kdb,Claude 3.7 is worse than 3.5 in Cursor RN,"Unpopular opinion


It’s way too eager, constantly trying to do stuff in the code even when you don’t ask it to. 
It straight-up ignores serious linter errors and always over-engineers everything. 
It also ignores rules - like if you say DRY, KISS, and YAGNI, it still keeps overthinking. 
It hyper-focuses on some problem, overanalyzes it, and immediately tries to “fix” it. And that sucks.

1ixa7r3,Introducing Cursor 0.46!,"This week we’re unveiling our latest major release, Cursor 0.46!

Download an install from [https://www.cursor.com/downloads](https://www.cursor.com/downloads)

**New Features**

* **Chat/Composer Unification:** We heard your feedback and have unified Chat, Composer and Agent into a single interface. Switch between modes as your needs change with each task during your session.
* **UI Glow Up:** Our new unified chat interface includes several design improvements to de-clutter the UI and improve your flow. Three new themes designed for the Cursor UI are now available. To select a theme, go to Settings > Theme > Color Theme in the Cursor menu.
* **Agent Web Access:** Agent now proactively searches the web to find information when needed without having to include \`@web\` in your prompts.
* **Secure .cursorignore:** New security rules ensure that files listed in .cursorignore are never shared with LLMs or seen by Cursor. The new .cursorindexignore file supports the previous ignore functionality that only limits files from indexing.
* **Agent Tool Limit:** When reaching the 25 tool call limit, the Agent now displays a button to continue beyond this limit with a single click. Bypassing the limit consumes an extra request.
* **New MCP Features:** MCP gains new features like Yolo mode, the ability to configure Project Servers with .cursor/mcp.json, and the ability for Agent to use MCP resources as context.
* **Improved Project Rules:** A visual indicator is now shown anytime a rules set is applied to a request, and rules can now be applied globally.
* **Claude 3.7 Sonnet:** Support for our newest Premium models from Anthropic, Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking - both enabled for Agent.

**Fixes**

* **Crash Fixes:** Several memory, performance and reliability improvements.
* **MCP Fixes**: Reliability and quality of life fixes to make building MCP servers in Cursor even better.
* **Windows Fixes**: 
   * Fixed newline error in Chat Codeblocks
   * Resolve issue with Cursor uninstalling itself",2025-02-24 11:14:06,257,124,0.99,cursor,NickCursor,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1ixa7r3/introducing_cursor_046/

Used .46 all yesterday and it felt extremely laggy - just the UI in general.  Activity monitor using 3.5GB+ memory and just typing and submitting prompts would take seconds and then when an action happened moving the mouse cursor over action of scrolling etc felt really laggy too.\\

Just opened it now and without doing anything the Renderer task will hit 40% CPU without even doing anything, just clicking in it.. scrolling a file much more.

It didn't seem to be the AI aspect of Cursor, but rather the base Renderer task using a lot of resources and acting very slow.

1j8qb1f,An ex-Visual Studio engineer's thoughts on Cursor,"We first introduced code completion (one of our marketing ""wizards"" named it *IntelliSence*) for Visual Studio in 1996. The way we figured out ""what came next"" back then wouldn't even remotely be thought of as ""AI"" by modern standards. Most of the ""magic"" relied heavily on lightweight background compilers to figure out things like, ""What existing variable names can be placed here that would compile cleanly?""

I eventually left MS to join the Xcode team at Apple. In total, I spent 16 years helping to create tools aimed specifically at software engineers. In that time I learned a great deal about how people of all experience levels interact with these types of tools.

Why the history lesson? Because back then there were ""purist"" developers who absolutely refused to enable features like IntelliSense. A lot of the initial feedback was, ""Real developers write their own code! You're going to turn developers into idiots!"" And remember, all we were really doing back then was suggesting the next variable or displaying possible parameters for a function.

I retired a few years ago and now spend a ton of my time volunteering to help individuals and startups solve technical problems. I still write code every day.

After two solid months of very slowly incorporating Cursor into my workflow I am 100% sold on its functionality. I constantly bump into experienced developers who are in the anti-Cursor camp until I show them how I use the tool. I'm not a ""vibe coder"" (what a ridiculous term) by any means but there have been countless times I had an idea for a feature that I let Cursor take a few shots at. In one instance it chose an algorithm I was unfamiliar with and worked perfectly. I love the freedom of being able to try out even crazy ideas in a frictionless, risk free, and timely manner.

It is awesome seeing VS Code being used in this way. It took over a *decade* to convince the company that a ""baby"" version of Visual Studio would be useful and I'm so glad to see that decision pay off.

The days of ""LLMs can't code"" are over. Anyone who bothers to take a deep dive understands that. Do we still need to ensure the code is correct? Of course... but that is true of code written by even the most experienced human engineer. I don't implicitly trust *anyone's* code. ;-) 

 That said, I would absolutely love to see models that are trained on real-world debugging scenarios. VS Code has some incredibly useful debugging facilities that Cursor should be able to integrate with directly. For example, if I stop at a breakpoint Cursor should be able to inspect the callstack and automatically examine the code at previous levels to determine if a bug happened earlier in the code execution, detect race conditions, etc. Anyone who has wasted days trying to track down complex threading/deadlock issues would love these types of features. 

Congrats to the Cursor team! You are literally changing how we create software. My prediction is that Cursor's feature set will become as ubiquitous as the ""old-school"" code completion is today.",2025-03-11 06:07:12,580,59,0.99,cursor,Knuth_Koder,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j8qb1f/an_exvisual_studio_engineers_thoughts_on_cursor/

For your use-cases, perhaps. But as someone who has been developing commercial software that's used by tens of millions of developers everyday, Cursor is, without a doubt, the most well-rounded product for professional developers. If I'm working on a project that doesn't require the full version of Visual Studio or Xcode, I'm using Cursor.

I'm currently developing my own version of superwhisper (I explain how [here](https://reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1jb6kjs/the_task_list_i_used_to_create_a_superwhisper)) and 99% of the code was written entirely by Claude 3.7 in Cursor. All of my private VS Code extensions work and I can even access the full 671B parameter Deepseek R1 model on a rented AMD cluster that I run myself. Cursor can run and evaluate even complex tools like filesystem and network analyzers. I have an integration that controls wireshark to handle all the normal network traffic analysis I'd have to perform manually.

> I really like this post, apart from specifically mentioning Cursor.

mh8q776,,"**Hi,**

I completely share your perspective and mindset. As it stands, these approaches excel as coding productivity tools—but they are not a replacement for creating good software solutions.

We are currently rolling out Cursor for all developers (on a non-mandatory basis). The ones who find it a bit more challenging are .NET C# backend developers who are accustomed to Visual Studio.

Interestingly, we just hired a recent graduate specializing in Data Science and Cognition to support the AI team. From a “low-level” tech perspective, his experience is primarily in Python and C. I introduced him to Cursor, and naturally, he used Python Notebooks to experiment with potential solutions to the problems I assigned him. However, I told him, *“This is great, but we need a UI so that non-technical users can better understand how it behaves. Do you know React, HTML, or JavaScript to build a basic UI for demonstration?”* He didn’t.

So, I had another team member showcase how Cursor could help him quickly build a simple page with the assistance of the AI agent. Without prior knowledge of HTML, he created a small UI for his prototype in just a day.

This was impressive—but in no way was the result production-ready. However, it provided a tangible feel for the solution and its technical challenges. I think this is where some people might get carried away; the results look ""magical"" for todays standards, but…

Maybe I’m just getting old, but I remain skeptical of these new platforms that promote *no-code* as a pathway to successful software solutions. Beyond prototyping, I wouldn’t rely on these approaches for large-scale, production-grade applications—at least not yet. That said, one of the strengths of tools like Cursor is their ability to bridge the gap between rapid prototyping and fully developed, production-ready solutions.

Additionally, I see great potential in integrating these technologies with solid *low-code* platforms like OutSystems, particularly for building standard line-of-business (LoB) applications and integration solutions. I think this is an exciting area of development for such platforms.

**Cheers.**

mh9bvpv,,"I've been working on my project for several months using Sonnet 3.5, and everything was running smoothly—until I tried Sonnet 3.7 last week.

Since then, I’ve encountered multiple issues. The most concerning ones include:

* It modified my `.xcodeproj` file, even though I never instructed it to do so, nor should it have been reading or modifying that file in the first place.
* It generated three copies of another file without any reason to do so.
* When I explicitly asked it to analyze an issue in a specific file, it not only analyzed it but also implemented various ""solutions"" on its own, which introduced multiple errors that I’m still trying to fix.
* Instead of analyzing the entire file as requested, it only considered a portion of it, then proceeded to modify the file based solely on that incomplete analysis. While this was easy to correct, it highlighted how easily it gets confused.

Overall, Sonnet 3.7 is generating files unnecessarily, duplicating existing files, modifying things it shouldn’t, and acting autonomously in ways that disrupt my workflow. Since encountering these issues, I’ve switched back to Sonnet 3.5, which remains the most stable version for me.

I started using cursor a few weeks ago, and I really liked it. However, it wasn't until sonnet 3.7 dropped that it really blew my mind. This was a couple of weeks ago roughly. I remember asking for a complex test suite and providing a lot of context, writing a long prompt, and composer one-shot it. As I was reading the generated code, I couldn't believe it.

But, I was quickly disappointed after updating Cursor (I think it was to 0.46, not entirely sure). Suddenly it was reading files slower, in chunks, but even for smaller tasks it seemed to be way less effective - missing existing functions in the files provided as context, etc. This has been the case ever since the composer was removed.

Currently with one you try to curate your cursor rules and prompting and keep adding to it whenever cursor does something you think it shouldn't or could do better with better rules/pre-prompt. But eventually you're giving it so much with that it seems like it can't remember it all and a lot of the rules or pre-prompt eventually gets ignored. 


Perhaps with multiple specialised agents it would allow us to split up those rules and pre-prompts among multiple agents so each doesn't have to remember so much and each has only the rules that are specific to it's task type. Plus with longer rules and pre-prompts theres a higher chance of unintentional contradiction that can ""confuse"" the model. Can't wait for the day i don't constantly have to tell the model to run tests and check fixes after debugging. It's supposed to currently but eventually it stops and just starts telling me to do them. With agentic teams i think a lot of issues and baby sitting would be solved or minimized.

mhk2qqe,,"Sure, try this: 676298e5-5e82-435c-a42b-3076f0947830

As you can see, I had to start manually tagging my various `.mdc` files in each prompt to make sure they got picked up.

I've been thinking about what could be the problem, by the way. I have been running this repo since cursor 0.43.

1. Do you think the codebase index got corrupted somewhere between the major versions? Perhaps I could regenerate from scratch?
2. My other idea is that my backend repo is just too big to use with Cursor's latest summarisation logic. The whole thing is over 100k lines of code. In Cline, without using Repomix, 30-60 minutes of prompting results in a context window of 500k tokens. This may explain why things are constantly being pruned out of Agent's mind. I should say though that my functions are well split, a single file is always less than 250 LOC and test files are usually under 1k.
3. I looked through my PRs and since Cursor 0.45 I have only added 20k LOC, so Composer *was* crushing an 85k LOC project before 0.46. It really seems like something happened around the decommissioning of Chat/Composer moment.

Over the last week my usage of Agent has evolved to only working on single file refactors and very limited scope work. Kind of a like a juiced up Cmd+K. It seems to do OK on these but can no longer work from specification documents like it used to.

I would really like to get Cursor back to where it was before. I am literally happy to 5-10x my monthly bill if that's what it takes. Please let me know how I can help.

1. Do the keyboard shortcuts include Ctrl-D closing the sidebar pane?

With simple edits 'thinking segment' can be easily 3x as longer compared to just edit. You just tripled your cost.

A lot of folks are making prompts like ""change the background of this element to gray"" where the edit is like 3 lines, but thinking segment will be 9 lines. So we got from 3 edit lines to 9 thinking + 3 edit lines (12 total) to do same thing. If Cursor paid $1 for 'X' amount of these, now they pay $4. With longer prompt the difference shrinks, but only Cursor know how ""average prompt"" looks like.

Maybe you don't know this and that's where confusion comes from - you do pay for thinking tokens too, no matter if its Anthropic or OpenAI, because its still an output from LLM requiring the same amount of power.

People pay a lot to use a product that constantly breaks and ships with updates that will leave you stranded until the team mitigates them with another update. People have real jobs and, for better or for worse, they rely on this product now—and they pay a hefty subscription to do so.

On the other hand, Cursor is a startup and they’ve hit PMF so hard that they really do not need your money at this point. They can ship broken products for the sake of testing in production and we’ll probably get a better product faster as a result. People will continue to pay for it even when it breaks.

At first it was really impressive, the autocomplete seamlessly integrates with our previous habits, but so much smarter.

Then you start using the chat, and the composer, more and more. First to solve small issues or parts of a library you don't understand. As you get used to it you delegate more and more of your work to the Composer and your work consists of designing how you want your project to work and leave almost all the code to the composer. And it sucks. As soon as you reach several files, different dependancies, libraries more or less unknown to the model it becomes so bad. Your life consists of waiting for it to spur shit code, ask to fix, wait, ask to fix, wait, get stuck, debug by hand, rince and repeat. 

It becomes extremely frustrating, you feel like you become dumber, the assistant actually loses your time instead of saving it.

mcqh1oa,,"As your codebase grows larger, it helps to change the way you guide the model. If you continue to interact with it as you did when working on simple tasks or tiny codebases, you may have disappointing results.

I find that for more complex codebases, it really helps to have an indexed requirements directory with files that you can reference when talking with the model. These can be higher-level specs that explain the different sections of the codebase, Mermaid diagrams that visualize flows/states/relationships, and requirements docs for specific aspects of the code. I continue to add these requirements docs when I find the model needs more guidance. For example, if the model is inconsistent with the way it implements a feature in different parts of the code, I'll ask it to create a requirements doc with rules for the feature. Then, any time it's updating code related to the feature, I'll reference the doc and ask that it ensures all updates comply with the doc's rules.

You should also build up rules for the model in ""Rules for AI"" (used on all Cursor projects) and ""Project Rules"" (used for a specific project and can be targeted to specific directories or files). I find the best way to write these rules is incrementally as you find the model getting confused or making mistakes.

Comments in the code can also help the model better understand how each file relates to the codebase as a whole.

Hopefully, these tips can give you some ideas on how to mitigate the challenges that come with AI-assisted programming on larger codebases.

It’s basically just a really beefy autocomplete plus a sort of macro engine (c preprocessor style, or like excel’s drag-to-continue-the-pattern). I only let it do actual structural work in three cases: 

1. A blank file. It’s quite competent at figuring out what boilerplate to spit out. 
2. CSS and HTML (when in the same context or same file). It’s quite good at designing new elements with their corresponding css. It’s better than me at from-scratch css; I’m better at refinement. 
3. OpenGL code. It has a quite good understanding of openGL and can produce solutions that would take me 15-30 mins of research to get, plus possibly trial and error and a lot of googling.

Outside of those cases, it is not a substitute for my brain. It just lets me type fewer characters to create the same program. Occasionally it outputs code using some language feature or standard library function that I wasn’t familiar with, which is a nice bonus.

Stop raging on OP like ""skill issue"".

I want to say: I feel you OP, been there a lot.

Indeed, most comments mention useful tactics / workarounds.

At the end of the day I think understanding the code matters the most.  
We're not yet at a stage where you can blindly trust the AI and let it do its thing.  
You have to verify the code written by the AI, thoroughly test it, and go small increment by small increment.

So it's a great productivity tool (lets you do faster what you already know how to do), but I wouldn't use it to substitute for what I don't know, from my experience this gets you lost pretty fast and ends up being counterproductive.

We shouldn't forget we are at the forefront of this revolution, messing around with these tools and pushing them to their max. The models will improve, and us early adopters we will be extremely proficient with Cursor et al. when the models are optimal. So like every new piece of tech, let's confidently go through the learning curve.

\- Sure, there are a lot of unreasonable expectations and silly complaints to dunk on.

\- Cursor does replace you \*for some tasks\*. Not all tasks, but some. I needed to write a bit of R code recently to separate out some highly parallel computations from a sequential process that needed to process those results in a specific order. Cursor effectively replaced me \*for the task of writing the solution to that problem\*.

\- Using cursor effectively means knowing where the line is between what cursor is more efficient at vs. what you are more efficient at.

\- People understandably get frustrated when that line is very hard to identify, is highly variable across domains.

\- People also seem to be under the impression that this line actually moves in subtle ways for the exact same model, which if true makes things way more frustrating.

\- Hard to say to what extent the above is true, but it isn't at all implausible that service providers are varying the amount of test time compute that is allowed depending on load or other factors and that this bleeds into the quality of cursor's coding.",2025-02-14 07:27:27,26,0,0.0,cursor,jrdnmdhl,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1ipcejv/cursor_is_so_dumb_no_youre_the_problem/mcqricg/

mctdbv4,,"????

What the fuck are you people even talking about right now. 3 months ago i could ask cursor to copy the code of X component and then do Z component based on that. it would work fine, furthermore, i could then do changes to Z component and tell it to based on that fix some other thing, it had no problem.

now it struggles to imitate X on Z and when i do changes to Z and tell it to based on those changes add something else, it goes back to its own version of Z disregarding the changes i just made.

this is clear degradation in the quality of the responses. it's not some ""projects grow"" bullshit because it happens with all projects, like I said, it happens on new and small projects as well as in big and complex projects.

you can twist it around as much as you like, the only truth is that cursor right now is much worse than it was 3 months ago.

the reason why the quality of the responses went down, is that the team at cursor constantly push updates that mess with the composer degrading the quality of the responses, i don't know if they do it unconciously or if they do it to cut costs, but it's obvious that the quality of the responses went down, i've been using cursor for 6+ months, it's not hard to notice that the quality is going down, specially because every week we get new quirks and shit we have to play around.

2 weeks ago it was slow responses taking 5+ minutes, now it's cursor being incapable of adapting to code changes which is maddening tbh. how is it possible that it ignores changes you do to your code?

to give you a clear example, i have a button, classname=""p-3 m-2"" i tell cursor to increase the margin, it outputs classname=""p-3 m-4"", fine, then i decide 4 was too much so i lower it to 3. i then ask it to do something else and it corrects the margin back to 4 even though i just gave it the new code that had the m-3. this was not an issue a few weeks ago, now it happens all the time. even if i literally tell it that i adapted their code and that it shoudl reanalize it, it still disregards what i'm passing to it and pulls code from before.

so essentially it's refusing to read new code thinking that it is the same, this is basic LLM lazyness and it happens when you reduce the amount of tokens.

# ""Cursor is so dumb"" - No, you're the problem

  
your take is very stupid, if you're telling the LLM to not do something, and it does it all the same, even though months ago it worked fine, then the issue is not the user, it's the quality of the response that has truly degraded.",2025-02-14 15:16:05,-1,0,0.0,cursor,TheNasky1,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1ipcejv/cursor_is_so_dumb_no_youre_the_problem/mctdbv4/

mhr5ac5,,"Fun question! Here’s my use case.

I started part-time work at a local newspaper in an ‘underserved community’ as an Ads & Media Manager. The current system was an absolute mess of a workflow, involving Trello and Quickbooks. I came home after my first day, and used Cursor to write an entire CRM sort of SaaS type web app, but specifically for my job. It took a few days. But is now about ready to replace the current workflow.

Not exactly something I could ever sell, due to being such a specific use case. But instead of getting some pricy SaaS that would only fit about 75% of our needs, I built the perfect one.

Lots of errors and stress throughout the road, but it was worth it.

Big LOL when Claude 3.5 forgot that issues meant ‘newspaper issue’ and instead thought it meant ‘problem’, and proceeded to break all of the code (I didn’t notice until it was too late).

mi223ji,,"Some said they need example boy do I have them (over 1400 hours of vibe coding with Cursor)

The REAL ISSUE that most seem to not see is not the models (Although 3.7 CANT see the terminal most times and is a timid coder he likes to put placeholders a lot unlike 3.5 who actually tries to code meaningful work)

It's the d**n apply model it messes up the diffs very often despite the AI knowing what needs to be changed the edit_tool has a serious bug somewhere and a hard limit that the AI ignores as in ""don't write large files all at once you can't"" and boom fails because he's trying to make an 800 like file.

The real update would be to go full transparency and let US CONTROL the AI I should be able to set how long it's edits will be. How much of a file to read (the AI struggles very hard with reviewing its own work with the read tool)
and how often it should ask for user feedback.

There are a few more issues but the apply model and DIFF edits malfunctioning ruin my code often with massive indentation issues and Sonnet will even get frustrated and call out the malfunction with Cursor doing things like dropping the read/edit tool all together and frustratingly try to use the terminal instead and usually always forgets we are on Powershell but that an Anthropic issue not Cursor

I work with AI to code every single day all day because my life depends on it so even with issues you can still do the work but these last few updates starting from the MCP release has made cursor much worse.

mi1f9g1,,"While they are indeed struggling to find the right balance, I’ve been messing around with roo cline, and while the full interference definitely produces better results more reliably, the cost is much much higher compared to cursor’s usage based pricing. It’s not a 1 to 1 comparison, but a task where I might use the equivalent of 3 Claude agent fast requests is costing $1-$3. With open router I blew $10 in api credits using 3.7 in a handful of longer agent runs. The same costs like $.25 in cursor. That’s a significant difference. Even windsurf charges for tool calls with flow credits. The only way to get comparable pricing is to use a deepseek api key with roo code and even that is a tad bit more expensive and seems to slightly lack the same abilities as Claude. Like computer use.

My overall point is that so far it seems like cursor is the least expensive. Which it’s important to acknowledge because you often get what you pay for.

Not stellar, but I could definitely get lift out of it. Used the right way for the right things I was fine with it. Claude 3.7 comes out and seems great in and of itself. The original cursor usage seemed great and improvement from that previous way of using in cursor. I could go farther with less oversight. But then wham... constant confusion... over doing it... getting lost all the time... recommending / doing like 15 things in one composer request that were way beyond the well specified scope. Quickly crossed the line of more work than reward. I could set the llm back to 3.5 but I'm sure you see how bad that feels. A new and improved llm to leverage... that we can't. 

This is the same feedback as a lot of the other posts, but the additional point I'm bringing up for cursor team to consider is: I never heard about cline before. It sounds like it uses 3.7 a lot better. I'm trying it out. If it's better it's better. I'm sure others will be picking up and trying out that option as well.

Type of work I do:  
traditional ml pipelines. Data -> feature construction -> fitting -> forecasting. some automl. Cursor is / was great. but there's enough fine grained detail / continuity of composer conversations needed to keep the momentum in implementing the current thing. the tradeoff is usually smaller thing per conversation = less oversight / chance of success. over the last 6 months composer has improved tremendously and that grew to medium thing with some oversight to be productive. but then this last week it's back to small thing with tight management and even then it runs away with itself.

Some bits its still not good at and the latest out of memory issues are super handicapping, but overall it works. Now on the no coding knowledge - its impossible. You have to guide the agent a lot and some complex bits take a couple of attempts. You need to be able to split the work into small manageable bits as you would for a junior developer and then iterate on it. It's definitely not good at iterating over logic and improving it sufficiently. It's pretty good on iterating over different designs however and refactoring them. If extra lazy a combination of cursor + online chat to deepseek/chatgpt works, as the cursor context is quite limited so this will raise the bar as to where you need to intervene, as long as you can accurately describe present issues and quickly iterate on testing.

I am the stereotype of creative guy and I have adhd so even a ; or forgot  closing things before ai makes me don’t beeing god. What I am obsessive. I really know how to use git and modularize and using local models. The thing it is that: the devs are using frameworks libraries and they really don’t know (most of all) what are really are doing in a deeply way. So you have to understand the way. Modilarization . I can make anything almost. I being invited to SF. With poor engs skills. My apps are extremely beautiful, I can spend 2 days for a transition or a sound. Maybe the devs who think they how to code in fact they stop to learn how it is to code nowadays. And I need ai? Yes! But I can keep going more with a local model without internet. The key is keeping clear your root, the control of the code. Use tiny components document what they do, I staring using ai in an intensive way and the roof was the context. You need to use version control to keep the flow. Has ai feel to know when you have to restart the composer or conversation. Exploring the best tech and arquitecture and learn the relevant thing. Linux and mac are brutal for devs the difference it is big. You can do anything now, don’t loose your time in debates.  Explore roots to have context less than 400 lines and console log to use another ai like Claude. Don’t use “the bronce tokens “ of the end of the cursor account. Change the focus. Don’t make repetitive questions . Refacing  if you loose the control of the code. You have to know how to code nowadays and are totally different things. Don’t fall in the ai loop detokenizer mode. Train your skills to have documentation control version using cross ai, local ai. It is antinatural start a new conversation , but the conversation are the whole prompt so keep it clean like your root. If you want to refining some component with openai 3o or something you can send the documentation carefully made it for each component and name. So yes you have to learn but it is persistence and curiosity , use gpt plus the best model and explain all and have an very good architecture.

mewhlnh,,"I worry about how many (more) bad and terrible apps and software is going to be out in the world over the next few years from people blindly just sticking it together till it works (kinda).  The amount of exploitable, bad performing, buggy and non maintainable software that makes no sense will be huge imo.  AI and cursor is great at helping you get up to speed, digging through APIs (when it doesn’t just make stuff up), writing flowcharts or docs, but if you don’t know what it’s writing or basic design you’re in trouble and it will do way more damage to you and your ability to learn.  
Think of it like this,
You’re trying to learn Spanish , so you get a translator and a tutor, now you don’t know Spanish, heck you don’t even know the syntax or grammar rules but you have to trust your translator is telling you correctly.  So if you ask it to translate The Dog and it returns “gato el” you probably think ok cool, not realizing that “Cat the” isn’t what you wanted, it might still work depending on what you’re trying to do but it definitely isn’t right.

If you’re trying to learn a language or how to program then stay off Agent mode or composer and only ask an AI if your stuck or what something means.  The auto complete can screw you if you don’t understand the basics and compose and agent will give you over complicated maddening results that you don’t have the basic understanding to decipher.

That said, I usually find that the second you start working on a problem that doesn’t have a commonly known solution, even if you describe your solution in detail to the point that any intern could pick up the task, there’s a pretty decent chance you’ll get a bad response.

In particular, when a codebase gets large enough (spread across multiple entry point apps and libs), I’ve found cursor starts to hallucinate dependencies, types, enum members, etc. Yes, even when I include the specific files to be used as dependencies. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great at what it does, but a single hallucinated dependency can easily ruin an entire set of output and clarifying further usually does not help.

I find it especially bad for making small specific changes, as just manually coding the solution with the help of cursor tab is WAY faster than writing up a plain-English description.

I’ve personally found my best workflow to be:
- Use composer for new files that need boilerplate while providing copious examples of similar files
- Use agent mode for writing tests
- Use chat mode like a rubber duck that knows how to code
- Use cursor tab + manual coding for everything else (it catches on VERY quickly)

Today i spent 5 hours using cursor 41.2 and did the same, this time I had more control and the implementation was not only 12 times more efficient (huge improvement to an already optimized system), but also worked fine and i didn't have to discard anything.

i think cursor .46 is good if you want to do something quick and small, the AI does everything and is pretty good at it too, but if you're building something big and complex i feel the agent mode just sucks, it first does things you don't ask for and second does too much at a time making it hard to keep track of things, additionally the new UI is shit imo, no more back/forward arrows, no more search bar for commands, 2 big features of vscode, removed for no reason.

mfxplt1,,"I mean that’s plain wrong.

Building an optimized web app isn’t that hard with cursor. You just gotta look at the complexity of that app. There is stuff that will be hard for someone clueless in cursor when it gets too complicated but some basic stuff using APIs and existing libraries? No problem.

But at the end I also have the feeling, the knowledge that you say someone “needs” can kinda be replaced with more grind in many instances. Also those arguments always read like they expect the non developer to be entirely stupid… you can still find out correct approaches to achieve your goals without knowing them at the beginning of the project.. just be honest with yourself and research the things you don’t know… with AI that’s as easy as never before…

The knowledgeable web dev will be way quicker achieving his stuff in cursor because he won’t do all kinds of stupid prompts.

But I would disagree in the notion that it’s impossible to also achieve it without actually being a dev… Just gotta box you out of the endless loops of errors when you don’t understand the issues (or just try again with a different prompt (or just ask for potential solutions and then go over to fix stuff)

I’m a designer foremost and have very barebones web devs skills and building a full blown iOS app with multiple functions works like a charm…

Will my code be the best? No. Will I achieve it as quickly as someone with knowledge? No.

Am I be capable of reaching my goals? I would argue yes…

To switch the tables here, I could equally argue that UI and UX cursor applies to the projects isn’t actually on par with following a real Design process and that Devs creating apps with cursor will still build trashy or ugly standard apps because they don’t know how to actually build nice and understandable user flows and stuff like that. What is the superior code worth with a trashy concept?

But here again, I personally believe the dev can achieve good levels with putting enough effort in himself… will it be as quick  to reach the goal or quality wise on paar with a designer doing it? Probably not, but it’s achievable to do great things still…

Building software around existing APis and libraries really isn’t that hard with cursor right now as a noob as long you’re willing to suffer a bit and have a not entirely stupid approach to the project.

mftxfxs,,"Thing is 1 you don’t know what you don’t know. There is a prompting advantage to those who know stuff. Even if it’s just what questions to ask. And if you start with little knowledge and learn what to ask over time you are actually learning programming. Maybe not the syntax of programming, but like the guy who wrote all the programming books Tim oreilly wrote in his blog recently, we’ve just hit a place where the next higher level programming language has become English. I’ve been at this long enough (ai coding) to confidently say nothing just magically appeared without a lot of thoughtful prompting and the English is basically the same as the logic of normal programming without needing to bother with the syntax of a language. 

As a developer it’s actually pretty freeing to vibe code in languages I don’t even understand myself for the most part. The field of programming is large enough that even if you are an expert in one area of it you can’t be in all areas of it. The fundamentals help you leap to other areas and draw parallels like do this thing I would have done in the language I know but in the language I don’t.

2. I know stuff and I’m still spending all my time prompting. Things get done much faster but the stuff I’m attempting to build alone now would have taken a team of 4 before over a period of months. I don’t doubt that the number of developers needed will decrease to create the same output over time, but as has always been in the case in the past the market just demands more. And maybe some day AI will be able to do the whole thing without developers, but right now I’m just trying to make more alone and that has me working all the time. Not sure how long it’s going to be before you don’t actually need any developers any more, but right now it still takes a lot of time with AI to build a full product and someone needs to do it as a job. And from a practical perspective there are real productivity advantages to someone trained in development using these tools over someone who isn’t and can only 100% vibe code. 

What is left to be seen though is what happens when you pit the 100% vibe coders against the developer luddites who refuse to use these new tools, of which there are many. I did a poll a little while back and it was something like 1/3+ developers refused to use ai tools because they were adamant they suck and they preferred the control of doing it all themselves. I think we might see the vibe coders beating experienced Luddite developers with experience at some point as the AI will just be so much faster than manual typing.

I wouldn’t poo poo the power of experienced developers who have also gone all in on these tools though. You don’t know what you don’t know and knowing stuff allows you to connect knowledge to capability instantly with ai. Can’t tell you the number of times I’m watching the agent code and I’m like “why are you doing this? Wouldn’t it make more sense to do this instead?” It course corrects and I save it from junking up the project with another thing it’s going to get confused about later. Which is sort of the other pole of this conversation, the people criticizing the output quality of LLMs. If you can read the code and understand the logic it’s not hard to notice when it leaves a clean pattern and to tell it to fix it and write a rule stopping it from doing it again.

By the time the industry truly doesn’t need developers to make stuff anymore ai agents are going to replace so many other jobs too. Yeah developers are scared to be replaced but everybody should be. The elite don’t have any plan for how the masses are going to make a living once the ai companies achieve their goal of replacing all labor with AI and machines. That’s the scariest part to me.

The scope is largely to achieve the baseline quality that even a very mediocre engineer will bring to the table.

When I look at all kinds of low/no code platforms to build websites and stuff like that for non devs, they are essentially already replaceable.

With AI non devs can suddenly create software. And while the framing here sounds like they would be inferior to the devs I disagree hard.

AI enables all kinds of people from different professional backgrounds to create software and make the ability to code secondary. Those people  surely are worse at coding, but they are way better than most devs at their very own topic.

Medical influenced people could build software concepts from scratch in their field that no dev would ever think of without the needed insight and that no company would ever build due to limited income potential.

It puts the app/software concept at the forefront imo.

Many nooby people had ideas for apps in their lives. Most never did it because of the development skill missing and being gatekeeped to not even try. That barrier is breaking down right now.

The future of coding with AI  will put good ideas on the forefront. Not good coding.

I’m pretty sure there are tons of apps and software to build around existing apis and libraries that haven’t been build yet. That potential is reachable to cursor users without much dev knowledge imo.",2025-03-04 02:04:36,2,0,0.0,cursor,lucashtpc,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j2ke0q/damn_you_cursor_46_and_you_too_sonnet_37/mfxqp8e/
mfu83i7,,"Yeah I think where we are disagreeing is you don’t think what you are doing is development because you aren’t writing a programming language to make your software. 

Given I don’t know what you are building I can assume though that you are giving instructions in English that when translated into code by AI are actually closer to code than you might realize. English has become the new higher level programming language. This is conceptually similar to when higher level languages like JavaScript or Python were created to simplify programming and got compiled down into assembly or c++. 

I’m sure there were people at the time who thought coding like that wasn’t real coding because real coding was writing straight assembly. But almost all coding became using higher level languages because it saved so much time.

Development at its core is the progress of starting with some requirements and working with the computer until it can do those requirements. That’s still what you are doing and still takes considerable time even with ai. It’s still a job and not every non developer would want to sit in front of the computer wrestling with the AI for hours until the goal was achieved. Regardless of how you get there if you are the one struggling in front of the machine until it’s done you are being a developer. 

I don’t think I would change my definition of this until you can make a fully functional app as fast as you can make a song with Suno ai for example. With a three sentence prompt you can make a professional 3 minute track. I’d be hard pressed to call that composing and would agree with you that it’s just prompting. Working with cursor is nothing like that. It’s hundreds of prompts to get even close to something that does anything. My original point though circling back wasn’t really to gate keep you from learning and building but more so pointing out how hard it still is and that people with experience developing still have a leg up and are still valuable using these tools. But rather than gatekeep and separate you to also point out that if you are spending significant time prompting you too are a developer now. And without you your idea would not get built. For now we still need developers.",2025-03-03 12:20:48,2,0,0.0,cursor,drumnation,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j2ke0q/damn_you_cursor_46_and_you_too_sonnet_37/mfu83i7/
1j1kemq,"Cursor is a Game-Changer, But You Still Need the Basics","I’ve been in software engineering for over 20 years and hold a PhD in ML. I love Cursor—it’s an incredible tool that can 10x productivity, especially when working within a known language or framework.

For my daily work, I primarily use Python, and most of the time, I know 90% of what needs to be done (the rest I look up along the way). In these cases, Cursor is amazing. It speeds up development, helps with boilerplate code, and fills in gaps efficiently.

However, I’ve also tested Cursor on technologies I wasn’t familiar with. I built a web app in Next.js despite having only worked with Angular before. While I eventually completed the project, it took a lot of iterations and requests. Then, I tried building an iOS app with SwiftUI. This time, I burned through countless requests, got stuck, and ultimately couldn’t finish it. At some point, it felt like I might succeed, but I realized I was just patching things together without fully understanding how they worked.

This experience taught me a key lesson: AI can help tremendously, but it’s not a shortcut to deep understanding. Trying to build a production-ready app without grasping the framework’s core concepts leads to frustration and wasted time. Now, I’ve decided to properly learn SwiftUI before attempting another project.

My advice? Before diving into a new stack, take time to understand its fundamentals—basic building blocks, core patterns, and underlying concepts. In the end, this approach is faster than bouncing from one dead end to another.",2025-03-01 22:18:11,251,51,0.98,cursor,ThickDoctor007,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j1kemq/cursor_is_a_gamechanger_but_you_still_need_the/

You need the ability to solve problems and in order to be able to solve problems you need to run into problems.

But my advice is to keep it reasonably minimal and then build on it over time.

You don't need this massive file with every single programming best practice outlined.

The reason for shitty AI output is not because it forgot about DRY or SOLID. And I find that giving it too much input, and having longer chats, is when it starts to fall apart a bit. So keep it light. And here's the thing: if you notice the same issues popping up again and again, just add a quick line telling it not to. Or even better, in your cursor chat just say please write me a cursorrule so that you stop doing this particular thing. And then chuck it in there.

Like mine will keep forgetting about nullish coallescing (??) in JS, and even after I fix it up it will revert my change in its future changes. So of course I put that rule in and it won't happen again.

And then at the top of the file, just write some text about what the project is about. If you have a particular file structure and way of organising code that is great to put in as well.

## Getting the best output

I have found *by far* the best thing for improving the output is telling it exactly where to find the code it might otherwise spit out at you. 

Like if you know it's going to need a certain function, or create a procedure very similar to something that exists, give it that context. And you don't necessarily need to tell it the exact function - we're trying to make our lives easier here, of course I still want this to be easier than just writing the code myself. 

After I tell it what I want I often just do a `see @schedule.ts @utils.ts @ScheduleHeader.tsx` and just include anything that will help it do its task - even in a more abstract ""here's how something vaguely similar has been done"" kind of way. 

The AI has been trained on a bunch of random code, so if there's anything particular to your project, then you need to tell it.

## Random tips

Okay and let's get into some rapid fire tips.

- I like Composer (Agent) for simple, low impact changes. And Chat (Ask) for everything else. Just the step of manually having to click apply and taking that extra second to think about the changes it's making, and in which files it's happening, rather than just be presented with a wave of green changes ready to get smashed in.
- Don't blindly accept code. It's always gonna come back to bite you.
- Every so often make sure you read and fully understand the most integral parts of your code, and refactor it *manually.* You will find a lot of gaps, and fixing it up means future AI-written code will be better.
- Ask ""is this the best way to do this?"" or ""have you considered xyz"".
- Learn when a problem is best solved manually.
- Take extra care when using AI to fix bugs. I think it's particularly weak at fixing anything but the silliest of bugs. And it can cause a lot of damage in the process.
- If it's a big and important task or you are setting the foundations for a feature, ask it to ask you any questions before writing code to make sure it has a full understanding of what you are trying to do.

One of the best things about AI is that you can now write code when your brain is fried, and tackling a problem would normally be outside of your reach.

It's great for sitting on the couch and cranking out some mostly decent code, but then other days of course you just spend an hour chasing ""You're right"" ""I see the issue now"" only to end up in a worse place than you started.

But I would recommend experimenting with it and learning how best to talk to it. It's not going away, and it's just another tool that you can use.

And if you're a junior developer I would of course be very wary with it. And anyone for that matter really. I do think there's something to be said for the atrophying of my coding skills.

I would add one thing that has had the biggest impact for me for improving Cursor's output quality and accuracy:

When using Agent mode and doing a big prompt, **ALWAYS** end your prompt with: **Ask any and all questions that might clarify this task for you**.

I find that Cursor always asks super relevant questions. Things it would've missed otherwise, but more importantly, things that **YOU** would have missed, or didn't even think about.

I’ve learned this the hard way by letting cursor yolo mode have its way with my project.

1iuvain,I've tested the new Cursor 0.46 - UI Update,"  
Hi,

full thread+updates here: 

[https://x.com/kregenrek/status/1892884736059613652](https://x.com/kregenrek/status/1892884736059613652)

**UI Update:**

Cursor 0.46 is here and we got some fresh UI Updates.  
  
Chat -> Ask  
Composer (normal) -> Edit  
Composer (agent) -> Agent  
  
You can switch between modes with ⌘+.

https://preview.redd.it/gie3c6fcsike1.png?width=2239&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b3a60c5e78102347fb47f6a5392a327c5ea44fd

**You can reference the terminal:**

https://reddit.com/link/1iuvain/video/e0iihjnwsike1/player

**Git Reference:**

Cursor 0.46 explains you what happened in a specific Git Commit.

https://reddit.com/link/1iuvain/video/lbfq3ajasike1/player

**No window switch anymore**

You can now switch between modes within the same context.  
  
For example, you can ask something and then start the agent based on that or vice versa. This eliminates the need to transfer context between windows.

TBH this is still confusing. I liked the old version better where don't had two buttons with the same highlighting style. It's like having a ""Ok"" and ""Confirm"" button. It also seems to be a bit buggy. If you apply and reapply files a few times, you don't get any changes.  
  
Save all -> Accept All  
Apply -> Apply all

**Cursorrules:**  
  
\- Global rules can now be set with the globe icon.  
\- Instead of ""globs"" its called Auto Attach (But its still called globs in the YAML Frontmatter Header).  
\- In the frontmatter you have now a new Option for the Global usage.

Applied rules are visible in the Chat

1isci4s,I gave up on using Cursor and here's why,"I mean, I'm not here to say that Cursor is not useful, I'm here to tell my own story as an indie dev.  
After a while and after the first excitement gasped away, I realised that there's a reason why coding is mind ""flow"" and concentration, you have to concentrate on what you're doing and doing it well, you have to remember what you did and why you did it, even after weeks.  
I ended up ""autopiloting"" my flow, I was not thinking at what I was doing. After few days I did not remember why some things were done like that, I did not remember what I've did simply because I was not focused while I was coding, I was just keep on pushing ""tab"" and thinking about something else and losing focus. I guess this could be the ""golden egg"" for employed devs because you simply squeeze your mind less and deliver the daily s\*\*t but I think this is not good on the long run, both for the dev and for the company.

I was just ""abusing"", it was too easy to code. Devs must know how to code and must focus on what they're doing to learn and improve. First I tought that a junior dev would have done the job of a senior and a newbie would have done the job of a junior, but now I don't think so anymore. You have to be accountable on the stuff I write and I can't just blame the AI when my code has flows or doesn't work.  
My new habit is the old one: asking chatGPT something and use it after critical review now it's fine for me but autopiloting my code I guess it's not good because I was too much temped to let the AI do my job and it was too easy to get carried away.",2025-02-18 05:20:24,112,71,0.85,cursor,Consistent_Sally_11,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1isci4s/i_gave_up_on_using_cursor_and_heres_why/

My code is still way too convoluted and complicated to let an AI touch it really, but I am refactoring the code slowly and introducing unit tests and integration tests everywhere. Having the AI write unit tests for me is really fantastic - as a solo dev, I really was lazy before and never bothered, but AI makes adding unit tests a lot easier and you can then go tweak those unit tests to be more comprehensive.

I've definitely found that if you don't give the AI context, it can really mess with your shit. Like today, I'd asked it about how it would approach a problem, so then I said ok go - add that solution to this file. What did it do? It replaced the entire 2000 line file with its own 50 lines of code...

Obviously I use git, so I reverted and then implemented the edits myself, but really this was my fault as the AI had very little context about this particular piece of code I was editing.

So - I'm heading towards having comprehensive unit tests, but that's not enough on its own (who's to say the AI won't just change your unit test so that the broken code passes? It has happened to me before!)

The extra stuff the AI really needs is an architectural overview of the work and a current-state-of-play. I found this really comprehensive article yesterday that I think we all should read:

[https://medium.com/@vrknetha/the-ultimate-guide-to-ai-powered-development-with-cursor-from-chaos-to-clean-code-fc679973bbc4](https://medium.com/@vrknetha/the-ultimate-guide-to-ai-powered-development-with-cursor-from-chaos-to-clean-code-fc679973bbc4)

tldr? AI is a tool, use it as such and do not abandon your software engineering principles. In fact, use it to strengthen them and make your code more robust.

edit: another approach I've been using is to give the AI permission to create a new 'migration' folder and for it to create sample code and tests within that folder along with a migration script for how it thinks these edits should be applied to the main code base. I've got a job like that to do this afternoon, to work through the list the AI made for me and it got a bunch of it spectacularly wrong, but copying over these bits and pieces manually makes me have full knowledge about what's going on in my own code base so this approach might suit you. The AIs are good at writing .md files, so give that a go. And figure out 'ask' mode instead of 'code' mode.

mdgi46h,,"The best analogy for me is pair programming. In pair programming, there are two roles, driver and navigator. The driver writes the code, while the navigator provides direction, oversight and corrections. I did intense pair programming while working for a project at pivotal labs. When I started using cursor/cline, etc I treated AI like the driver, and I'm the navigator, but full time. What's important is understanding the role of the navigator. You aren't a neutral observer. Your role is to closely watch the driver, think about corrections, provide feedback, etc. If the driver can't explain what they are doing, you need to stop and ask. When the driver starts to veer off course, you need to help provide direction. As the navigator you need to ensure that the principles, like DRY, KISS, YAGNI, etc are all maintained. I also highly recommend doing TDD. This ensures that even if it produces code you don't quite understand, you have confidence that it's implemented correctly as the tests can act as like a proof of  it working according to intended behaviour.

mea3atj,,"I don't fully agree with your viewpoint, but I understand and respect your decision.

Perhaps because you're so familiar with technical details, you don't feel the need for AI assistance. Everyone is at different levels and stages, so their requirements for AI will vary accordingly.

For me, AI programming, especially Cursor, is incredibly useful! It brings back that initial feeling of learning to program - that sensation of solving problems with simple thinking. Programming should serve to complete tasks, and if there's a simple way to achieve it, it shouldn't be complicated. When I first learned VB or C, I felt programming was truly enjoyable. Simple tasks could be completed easily, and even complex tasks felt manageable by combining a series of simple methods.

But what has programming become in recent years? New frameworks appear almost every month, each with its own set of complex rules. Now, even implementing the simplest task has become very complicated. For example, adding a browser control to a window - in VB, you could just drag and drop the control, and a few lines of code would complete many tasks. After switching to the .NET platform, this same task became extremely complex. I've done this type of design several times, but I still can't remember how to do it and need to refer to my notes.

Now AI handles all these complex details for you, eliminating the complexity of these frameworks. It allows people to have an easier time. However, AI applications might gradually become more complex themselves - this seems to be a general rule of how things work, and might be unavoidable.

mebsnj9,,"Couldn’t have said it better. Every AI has a free tier and you can just manually copy and paste from the web or desktop interface to vs code. Cursors paid plan (excluding their custom auto complete model) is you just prepaying a quota of calls for paid AI. The free program AI will still give you the same answers just less per day. 

I also don’t know if cursor is trying to market to an audience outside of the US at that price point (where they would see the price is an obvious issue). Cursor is considered incredibly cheap in the US at 0.5% of the monthly median US wage and they are still one of the fastest growing startups of all time in user base, revenue, and investor funding. 

Cline is a vs code extension that is essentially cursor composer but you just need to plug in the api key. If you have an api key from someone like deepseek, you can just put that in cline and have 90% of the cursor experience. You just have to pay for what you use. 

The issue with AI is the compute requirements in a capitalist world ensure it can’t be given away so we are in a weird spot where the competition isn’t favorable for anyone not in the US yet. Google seems to be the only player who can afford to “give away” high tier gemini compute because they are the only enterprise player and can afford to do so. The others are beholden to their investors and the tight competition that is more important for the small research startups to win at because they don’t have 20 years of business they can fall back on like Google.

1j56j7i,Found a workaround for Cursor context limit,"I found a really good workaround for this problem everyone has been having, but it takes about an hour of setup.

1. Set up a Google Gemini API key (free)
2. Set up `cursor-tools` (you can find this on GitHub)
3. Follow the installation steps and integrate it into your project (the cursorrules file is important)
4. Every time you give big instructions, at the bottom of the prompt tell Agent to ""ask Gemini to help you plan, and when you are finished, ask it to review your work""
5. `cursor-tools` zips the *entire* repo, uploads it to Gemini (which has a 2 million context token window), and it comes back with very clever analysis and a smart feedback loop for Agent. They kind of start talking to each other which is really cool to watch.

This workflow is generating really good results. I guess a lot of the intelligence problems really are down to the context summarisation.

The other thing I found works well is to ignore the new ""Start a new chat for better results"" message. Starting a new chat seems to lower the IQ of Cursor a lot, so I am sticking to the same chat for a day or two until a feature/project is completed.

Edit: I would recommend only attempting this if you are an experienced developer, because I've had to solve numerous configuration issues over the last 24 hours to get to 100% perfection, and even now it could break at any moment. But it is pretty incredible. My Cursor (v0.46.10) is one shotting very complex tasks again with Claude 3.7 Thinking + Gemini Pro.

Notes:

- 0.5.0, the version you can just npm install right now, only seems to work up to 1 million tokens
- 0.6.0-alpha.7 supports OpenRouter and [you can force it to use the 2 million token model](https://github.com/eastlondoner/cursor-tools/issues/57)
- But the alpha version randomly crashes about 1 in 10 times. You will waste fast requests restoring checkpoint and restarting it, if you care about that.
- Auto setup seems to automatically create the .cursorrules file but it doesn't work all the time, you should create the [.mdc](https://github.com/eastlondoner/cursor-tools/blob/2fbb1dfd5760c4712b98489bd133095225432827/.cursor/rules/cursor-tools.mdc) file instead.
- If you have a complex shell setup with zsh, zshell, nvm etc, cursor-tools might not be available inside the Agent's shell. You will have to debug this yourself.

I would go with the 0.5.0 version and the AI Studio key, not the 0.6.0-alpha.7 OpenRouter way, unless you have a huge repo or like getting hurt on the bleeding edge",2025-03-06 13:23:41,125,48,1.0,cursor,nfrmn,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j56j7i/found_a_workaround_for_cursor_context_limit/

How many times have you thought

1. This is a lot to keep track of, I'm lost, 'I'm not sure where I am' 
   1. This can be because you had to go off on a tangent to fix a little bug, or, because the task you're trying to do is so big, you've just lost track.
2. I wish I'd documented what I asked for, so I can learn next time how to do this better
3. It's lost, it's forgotten all the little details I told it and now  it's guessing

We have a solution, and it's simple.

In Agent Mode, type out what you want it to do, or better still, type it in a text editor and copy and paste in, you can use new lines simpler.



**\*tell it to PLAN this work and not actually implement it.\***

**\*tell it to ask you questions\***

When it's done that.

write this prompt.

You will be wildly impressed to see the [todolist.md](http://todolist.md) file created with tick boxes.

\*2nd to last step....\*

Check in the [Todo.md](http://Todo.md) file to git.   
Now it's checked it, you'll clearly see exactly where it's got too, and any changes made to it, as it goes.

Last step...

>""implement that tasks in [TODO.md](http://TODO.md), be sure to tick them off as you complete them.""

And off it goes.

Is it 100% bulletproof perfect? no, it still made some mistakes. But it really helps you keep track of progress, and fix things faster too.

Also, it did just keep going, and going, and going, FANTASTIC.

While I discard most of them for lacking unique value, some truly stand out. However, with the influx of options, it can be challenging to find the best ones. 

Here are some LLM tools I currently use:  

1. ChatGPT Mac app - primarily because of a team pro subscription.  

2. Repo Prompt - also due to the team pro subscription. However, it will soon shift to a paid plan, and I plan to switch to a free alternative or create my own version by forking PasteMax. I expect some MCP features will be introduced in the ChatGPT Mac app, or we may transition to Claude.  

3. [itsdart.com](http://itsdart.com) \- I have been using it daily since I installed it.  

4. Ollama - for testing models and more.  

5. Several tools from Simon Willison (https://simonwillison.net/) and his blog, which I read daily. I prefer this over getting lost in a flood of YouTube ""content"" creators, as it helps maintain my productivity.  

6. Talktastic as my VTT.  

7. Goose - I'm unsure about it; it's still buggy, and if we switch to Claude, I would likely stick with that.  

8. Aider - I still use it, but less frequently, as Cursor, Roo, Cline, etc., have been equally effective. I find I waste more time switching between tools and catching up on change logs than learning how to maximize one or two tools.  

There are several other tools, but they are not specifically LLM-related.

1iojub2,How I solved Cursor's hallucination problems with Supabase using 2 MCP Protocols,"Hey r/cursor!

I wanted to share some interesting findings from my recent experiments with Cursor AI and Supabase integration. Like many of you, I've been frustrated with Cursor occasionally hallucinating when generating React components, especially when dealing with complex database schemas.

I've been working on a solution using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that has dramatically improved the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated code. The key breakthrough came from creating a dedicated MCP server that acts as a ""truth source"" for Supabase schema information.

What's different about this approach:

* Instead of relying on Cursor to interpret database structures from code snippets, the MCP server provides real-time, accurate schema information
* The server understands complex relationships, RLS policies, and type constraints, preventing common AI hallucinations
* Generated React components are always in sync with the actual database structure
* No more back-and-forth fixing incorrect type assumptions or mismatched field names

Some unexpected benefits I discovered:

* The AI generates much more precise TypeScript types since it has direct access to the schema
* RLS policies are automatically considered when generating data fetching logic
* Foreign key relationships are properly maintained in forms and data displays
* Schema changes are immediately reflected without needing to update context files

I've also developed a dynamic context system using gemini-2.0-pro-exp that automatically updates as your codebase context and instructions as it evolves, which has been a game-changer for larger projects. The AI seems to understand the codebase much better than with static  @ Codebase references.

Questions for the community:

* Has anyone else experimented with MCP for improving AI accuracy?
* What are your biggest pain points with Cursor generating database-connected components?
* Would you be interested in seeing this released as an open-source tool?

I'm particularly curious about your experiences with Cursor hallucinations in database-heavy applications and how you've addressed them.

1j2rgj2,🚀 Just Released: Cursor Rules CLI - Auto-scan your project & install relevant Cursor rules in one command,"Disclaimer: This is a community-driven project not officially associated with Cursor.I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions! Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey r/cursor community!

I'm excited to share a tool I've been working on that makes finding and installing Cursor rules super easy: Cursor Rules CLI.

https://i.redd.it/sk0xovit2jme1.gif

What it does:

* 🔍 Automatically scans your project to detect libraries and frameworks
* 📥 Installs the most relevant Cursor rules directly to your rules folder
* 🎨 Beautiful, intuitive CLI interface
* 🔒 100% privacy-focused (all scanning happens locally)

How it works: Just run cursor-rules in your project directory, and it does all the work for you - no more manual searching or guessing which rules you need!

    pip install cursor-rules
    # Scan your project and install matching rules
    cursor-rules

What makes it special: The rules are created using a  two-step process:

1. Semantic search with Exa to gather best practices
2. LLM enhancement to create structured, optimized content

I have it build a heavy amount of unit testing. I make it get up to 80% code coverage (80% of the lines of code are tested). I also ask it to build end-to-end tests. For example, if I’m building an endpoint, I have it create the endpoint in a docker container. I have any dependencies like Redis or postresql spun up with fake data in a container. I also have a container spun up that pings this endpoint and ensures all of the pieces work. 

This is how I see it, unit testing is like building each piece of the bike to make sure it works. End to end testing makes sure you can ride the bike correctly.

1ipqiyg,Maximizing Cursor AI – What’s Your Best Workflow Hack?,"I’ve been using the Cursor pro plan for close to **4 months now**. I’m constantly trying out new ways to optimize my workflow to write code easier/faster.

**These have worked for me:**

* Optimizing `.cursorrules` by having the agent ""self-improve"" the rules after a coding session.
* Using debug statements liberally to help the agent find issues
* I ask it to start every reply with a random animal emoji 🦊. If I no longer see the emoji then I know it’s lost context

**Wins:**

* The self-improvement does seem to help to a point
* I am pretty hard core about starting new sessions an that helps a lot
* Debug statements do help it fix issues. Without them it tends to spin out.

**Losses:**

* Agent mode spins out when working on less popular tech (not js or react).
   * Firebase functions written in typescript
   * SwiftUI code
   * Svelte 5
* Forgetting to use a `.cursorrules` file or the new rules/\* in a project

I had ChatGPT + Canvas create a `readme-brainstorm.md` from all the information we generated. From there several others were created `readme-milestone-planning.md` and `readme-next-days-agenda.md`.

In Cursor, after init new project, install all dependencies, I told it to read the above readme docs and break it down into more manageable files. 

`readme-milestone-planning.md` has all the project goals, tasks, sub-tasks, version numbers for releases/deployments. We update this frequently throughout the day. Some of the larger tasks got their own docs file.

`readme-next-days-agenda.md` has 3 main headings: Current Project Status, Completed Today, and Next Steps. We refer to this at the start and end of my 'Daily Sprints'.

The second project has grown far more complex than initially anticipated. And we often times end up creating new `readme-*.md` docs. At this point I now have over a dozen markdown docs files: schema, seo, terms, testing-strategy, various features.

Also, I started with a basic `.cursorrules` file and tell Cursor to update as needed.

Example: sometimes it wants to install something we don't need or is already installed, or sometimes vee-validate would conflict with shadcn, or it would forget to use `<NuxtImg>` instead of `<img>`.

Recently we struggled to get proper form sumission handler typing correct. After we got the right syntax, I asked Composer ""what did we learn today?"", and it would outline what it did wrong and what the solution was. So I would tell it to add that solution to `.cursorrules`.

My cursorrules file is over 400 lines long. I got curious around 300 lines, thinking it was too big/complex. I've seen others use markdown for their rules, but mine is json formatted. I duplicated the cursorrules (.cursorrules-01 & .cursorrules-020, one in markdown, the other json structured. In Composer I told it to read both files and asked it which it preferred?! It actually chose the json structure. It said it preferred that method, so I told it to rewrite it to be more efficient, and it ended up restructuring the whole thing along with varying priorities, references to my other doc files, it listed all the Nuxt modules in use.

mhf1s0w,,"I was originally building an app in Cursor using React/Vite/Shadcn/ui with a mixture of [v0.dev](http://v0.dev) to help prototype the look.

A few days ago, I decided to completely rebuild the whole thing in v0.  It's going well, not as easy to manually modify files and such as Cursor, but sometimes the output from v0 is way better than what I had in mind.

It's nice to have it all in one place now instead of copying and pasting code between the two.

Granted, with v0 you're stuck with next.js if that's an issue.  To be honest, so far being able to build it in v0 and directly deploy it has been a breeze.  I don't immediately have any backend ambitions for my app, so I'm not sure how well v0 handles that.

One major thing I'd love for v0 to handle would be referencing other files just like Cursor can.  I started building different elements as different chats but can't currently call on them within a project.  I'd love to be like, ""Let's create a button that opens @ table or something...

Following that pattern seems to work for me, I just built my first app doing just that, I won't post a link here to not promote but you can see the UI results are pretty good with some direction. You can also customize your shadcn styles it doesn't really have to all look the same.

Also you can use v0 w/o a sub if you are not in a hurry to build all in one go.

1j21lo8,Cursor vs Claude Code,"I've tried Claude Code over the last few days on a few Ruby on Rails 7 and 8 codebases that I work on.   
  
It's interesting, and it has a few features that would be good additions to Cursor.   
  
Compared to cursor:

The good:

* Very high code quality. This thing blows Cursor out of the water. I can't believe both use the same model when I see the difference in how Claude-3.7 behaves in Cursor and how it behaves in Claude Code. It's a completely different experience, on the same codebase with the same model. 
* It reports if its context is nearly filled, and allows you to compact it (summarise) or clear it. Great feature that Cursor should have too. 
* No 'can't connect to Anthropic' or 'can't connect to OpenAI' errors.
* Less errors compared to Cursor operating on the same codebase after writing code.
* I've had no functionality breaking mistakes, which do happen every now and then with Cursor, where it just breaks something or large files are truncated. 

The bad:

* It's not an IDE, but a node based terminal application that works on your codebase. That makes it a bit harder to work with (it would be fun to run it on an old VT200 terminal by the way). 
* The price! Working on just a few new features in a Rails app for around 3 hours kost me around $20,- in Claude Code. That's not cheap compared to what I pay for Cursor in a month and definitely something Claude should fix. 
* No MCP servers in Claude Code (at least I haven't been able to figure out how), though I haven't really missed them. Since it's a terminal app, Claude Code can execute all sorts of commands.   
* Cursor on the other hand is much cheaper, but that might also be its downfall. I'm perfectly willing to to pay more for Cursor if the quality it delivers is higher and more consistent.

Well... it turns out if you connect Supabase to Cursor / Windsurf via MCP server you essentially get an AI database agent that can not only write SQL queries (baby stuff), but actually:

* execute them
* debug them
* iterate on them

It's now possible to just ask it ""Count the number of messages my users sent"" and it will iterate until completion. 🤯 Check out how it works in the demo video.

\---

**How to set it up:**

* Clone the repo
* Install dependencies
* Add MCP server to Cursor & Windsurf
* Enjoy! 🙌

There are more detailed instructions in the README file of the repo itself.

So here is v0.2.1. It's mainly focused on simplifying setup and configuration:

* install with `pipx install supabase-mcp-server`
* run with `supabase-mcp-server`
* configure with `mcp-config.json` (Windsurf) or global `.env` file (Cursor)

Plus significantly improved documentation regarding setup & usage for both.

  
😊 Enjoy and please do report issues (this is my first release of a python package, be brutally honest, but gentle).

md1ky6c,,"Hey, u/T1nker1220 yep

to clarify the step:

1. Create .env file and fill in project ref and password env vars only if you need to connect to staging / production db. Connection to a local instance should be handled by default as long as you didn't modify the default host and port and password

2. There will be not terminal window popping up after you connect to Cursor. 

3. After adding an MCP server to Cursor, connection is colored green, you don't get any notifications from IDE, but once you go into an agent mode in Compose, your agent should have access to tools.



Note how project ref looks like (see highlighted part in the screenshot)

md6aqwl,,"u/Zazzen & u/irojo5 , Supabase CLI is a terminal utility to control / work with your supabase instances, which you control by executing commands in terminal

  
an MCP server such as the one I developed, allows you to let Cursor agent or Windsurf cascade to not only write SQL queries but also execute them on your behalf. 

Those two are different things entirely. Think of an MCP server like an intermediary between Cursor and your Supabase instance which exposes 'tools' for Cursor agent to use. In this case, the MCP server I built enables IDEs to execute SQL queries, but I plan to expand on the tools functionality to include support for all Python SDK methods and objects

The models are the king.

We have open source agents now that work directly with models (via your own API key) such as anthropics own Claude code. RooCode looks interesting too. This is fundamentally against Cursor's model in my opinion and not sustainable.

This is especially of note in the last week when an update was made by cursor that according to some thwarted the context window. Taking ownership of the context window like that and not in a transparent way makes it an issue.

The main reason I’m using Firebase is that we originally built our iOS app with it. We started a startup and are actually more like mobile/iOS engineers. We’ve never really built anything production-ready for the web, so Cursor seems like a huge help for getting up to speed quickly.

Right now, we’re basically rebuilding everything from scratch, our apps and we also want to develop a control panel where our customers can manage everything.

mhxrghk,,"I subscribed to both and have been using Claude Code this month as a bake off. They all have their pros and cons. Claude Code is the best quality. Cursor is a better generalist than windsurf, but windsurf does a better job working on smaller scopes that have related dependencies in the project. 

Claude Code also costs me about $10 if I use it for a 3-4 hour session. Cursor, I hit the credit limit in about 10 days and went to slow mode. Windsurf’s flow credits are untenable at this point. For $60 I got 3,000 monthly credits and cheaper packs of more. Each tool call is a credit. 

Sonnet 3.7 does a lot more lot smaller tool calls to learn the real context. People complain, but I’ve found the accuracy improved because of it in an enterprise stack. Claude code does a lot of prompt caching behind the scenes to make the price cheaper.  And a lot of the tool calls are reading like 10 lines, but it’s all the same to windsurf. 

So my 3,000 credits for $60 to codeium if I average say 15 tool calls per prompt would be equal to 200 cursor credits out of the 500 I get for $20/mo. And windsurf doesn’t have a slow credit like system. If you have no flow credits, you get a copilot level functionality. All that ends up making windsurf even more expensive than Claude Code. 

So if I were to rank in order of quality:

1. Claude Code

3. Windsurf

If you want to try out mcp (model context protocol) with little to no setup:

I built https://skeet.build where anyone can try out mcp for cursor and dev tools.

We did this because of a painpoint I experienced as an engineer having to deal with crummy mcp setup, lack of support where we need it most like Jira and Linear - updating slack and all that friction that engineers hate doing.

Mostly for workflows that I like:

* start a PR with a summary of what I just did
* slack or comment to linear/Jira with a summary of what I pushed
* pull this issue from sentry and fix it
* Find a bug a create a linear issue to fix it
* ⁠pull this linear issue and do a first pass
* pull in this Notion doc with a PRD then create an API reference for it based on this code
* Postgres or MySQL schemas for rapid model development

Everyone seems to go for the hype but ease of use, practical pragmatic developer workflows, and high quality polished mcp servers are what we’re focused on

How does the IP ownership play out? What if a major bug causes massive loss due to ""productivity"" improvements. Who owns the liability etc?

My group would poke around independently on the problem set, try to synthesize information, and then we’d get together  and debrief what we figured out. Many times we’d have “experts” for certain problems, and the point was to complete the assignment and understand all parts of all problems.

The only people who were ultimately burned come midterms/finals were the ones mindlessly copying and not really trying to understand.

For example if you end up at a startup, being able to deliver software that either helps you learn what is valuable or is valuable to your users is the only goal. My founders aren’t really concerned with maintainability when the app has like two pages that are center focus anyway. 

Contrast this against a larger company that has millions of dollars in annual revenue, 30 engineers, and 5 active versions. You need to be much more concerned about creating maintainable code that everyone can understand and possibly depending on your function, code they can also use in a way that preserves company coding styles and preventions.

To provide its features, Cursor makes AI requests to our server. This happens for many different reasons. For example, we send AI requests when you ask questions in chat, we send AI requests on every keystroke so that Cursor Tab can make suggestions for you, and we may also send AI requests in the background for building up context or looking for bugs to show you.

An AI request generally includes context such as your recently viewed files, your conversation history, and relevant pieces of code based on language server information. This code data is sent to our infrastructure on AWS, and then to the appropriate language model inference provider (Fireworks/OpenAI/Anthropic/Google). Note that the requests always hit our infrastructure on AWS even if you have configured your own API key for OpenAI in the settings.

We currently do not have the ability to direct-route from the Cursor app to your enterprise deployment of OpenAI/Azure/Anthropic, as our prompt-building happens on our server, and our custom models on Fireworks are critical in providing a good user experience. We do not yet have a self-hosted server deployment option

If you want to try out mcp (model context protocol) with little to no setup:

I built https://skeet.build where anyone can try out mcp for cursor and dev tools.

We did this because of a painpoint I experienced as an engineer having to deal with crummy mcp setup, lack of support where we need it most like Jira and Linear - updating slack and all that friction that engineers hate doing.

Mostly for workflows that I like:

* start a PR with a summary of what I just did
* slack or comment to linear/Jira with a summary of what I pushed
* pull this issue from sentry and fix it
* Find a bug a create a linear issue to fix it
* ⁠pull this linear issue and do a first pass
* pull in this Notion doc with a PRD then create an API reference for it based on this code
* Postgres or MySQL schemas for rapid model development

Everyone seems to go for the hype but ease of use, practical pragmatic developer workflows, and high quality polished mcp servers are what we’re focused on

1j8s1w7,You’re using Cursor rules the wrong way,"I spent too much time fixing AI-generated code. After testing different approaches, I found a way to build rules that actually works.

Here’s what made the biggest difference:

1. Force Cursor in .cursorrules file to follow your .mdc project rules

2. Keep rules simple and focused. Don’t dump everything into one big file

3. Create a new rule whenever AI repeats a mistake

4. Let AI write rules for you. Use meta-rules to automate this

5. Enable visibility rules to see what’s applied in every AI action

To make understanding easier, I built an interactive course where you can try these approaches in Cursor IDE with real examples. Check it out, it’s free: [https://enlightby.ai/#/projects/35](https://enlightby.ai/#/projects/35)

You can also find extension on Visual Studio marketplace: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ai-dl.enlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ai-dl.enlighter)

1j17kgo,Quick Guide: Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP (talk to your database),"**Quick Guide: Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP**

If you're trying to hook up your Supabase database with Cursor (using MCP), here's a quick, straightforward guide. This setup lets you interact directly with your database through natural language—so you can just tell Cursor Composer what you want (like querying data, adding tables, etc.) without fiddling with manual SQL every time.

I struggled for hours last night because I skipped this step at first. Without this, Cursor just couldn't get accurate context from Supabase, even when I fed it the docs directly.

Here's what worked for me:

**Step 1: Get your Supabase connection string**

* Log in at [Supabase]() and pick your project.
* Head over to your project's connection settings.
* You’ll see a connection string there. Replace any placeholder passwords with your actual database password.
* Copy this entire connection string (you'll need it for Cursor).

**Step 2: Add your MCP server in Cursor**

* Open Cursor and navigate to Settings → Features.
* Scroll down past the ""Codebase indexing"" section until you see the MCP servers area.
* Click on **""Add New MCP Server""**.
   * Set type as **Command**.
   * Name it clearly (mine is just ""Supabase - My App"").
   * Paste the connection string you copied from Supabase here.
* Hit save.

**Step 3: Try it out**

* Now you can use Cursor Composer or similar tools to run queries directly against your Supabase database without leaving Cursor.
* Run a quick test (like asking it for a list of tables) to make sure it's connected properly.

Quick tip from experience—make sure you back up your database first. I didn't, and cleaning up mistakes afterwards took ages.

Hope this saves someone else the headache!

1j6qm58,Cursor DESTROYED MailChimp in 304 words,"Have you ever wanted to send email 'alerts' to your customers?

You probably thought of Mailchimp, or if you're into open source Mautic. Both great options, but I have serious number of different lists to create and aspirations for more.

This is how Cursor wrote a complete, working, fully functional, I mean confirmation double opt in, the alert email template, subscriber list, preference page, subscribe box, the whole lot in ... THREE HUNDRED WORDS of prompting!

Let's back up a bit, a little context

I created [https://pricepergig.com/](https://pricepergig.com/) \- a site to sort, filter, find all the cheapest hard disk drives, SSD and NVMe drives, order by price per GB/TB and now, get instant alerts so you get the cheapest prices.

The problem? Send email alerts to people with the current cheapest HDD, SSD, NVMe drive on their chosen Amazon store for their chosen threshold. e.g. I want amazon co uk hard disks, known brands, where they are less than £13/TB, don't send me anything more expensive than that.

I worked out, with about 8 amazon websites, known brands, unknown brands, HDD, SSD, and NVMe, that a total of 72 different 'lists' on something like Mailchimp (I don't know if it can do variables, Mautic can, but one look at the docs and I'm thinking, but Cursor can just do this).

ANYWAY - I'm a developer with super powers (aka Cursor) so I'll just write my own...

I use my spec document technique, and only 304 words, played on the xbox for 20 mins (I am terrible at Warzone), clicked 'accept' a bunch of times, went to make a cup of tea to review and BOOM, I had 'confirmation' emails AND a fully working 'alert' email. 

It would have taken me longer to make the two email templates alone! This is incredible .

Thanks @ Cursor.  


\# Only if you're interested, here are the prompts #

  
Using my spec document technique, I wrote the spec - and I'm cheating a bit here, I'm not including these words in the word count BECAUSE I'd have to a) write this for a human to implement or b) go read all the docs for mailchimp or mautic and click around for hours figuring it out, so this, imo, is less work than any of those.

    # Goal
    
    We want to send emails to users when they have certain thresholds of listings.
    
    # Features
    
    User's on the front end can subscribe to emails, at that point they choose the options they would like notifications for along with a price per TB or price per GB. threshold to be met.
    When the best price in that category is met, we send an email to the user with the listing details and link directly to the listing.
    
    We will store the users email address and preferences in a table.
    
    We need a front end for the user to manage their email preferences. 
    Users should have to double opt in / confirm their email address for it to become active on the list. 
    
    we should use the same react components for the user preferences as we do on the main site/subscribe component.
    
    we will also need a super simple front end looking component that takes just the user's email address. when a user enters their email address and a threshold price we should send that to the backend and store it in the database, then send the user a confirmation email, once the user confirms their email address we should update the user's status to active on the list. The user can then update their exact preferences.
    
    ## User preferences
    Users can choose from the following options to get notified for:
                ""nvme-m2"" - Cheapest NVMe M.2 SSD (any brand)
                ""nvme-m2-branded"" - Cheapest NVMe M.2 SSD (known branded)
                ""ssd-internal"" - Cheapest Internal SSD (any brand)
                ""ssd-internal-branded"" - Cheapest Internal SSD (known branded)

    you will find we already calculate the best price for any item in the database in the pricepergig-backend-webapi/webapi/PPG.Services/BestListingService.cs file. we already have a webhook, we just need to add the logic to call an email service or similar there with the new best listing details - then the new notification service will handle the rest (find users that wanted that notification/threshold etc. and send them an email)
    
    Users can choose their language, but during the signup process we should just default to the currently selected language on the site (set in /ppg/pricepergig-frontend/src/Header.tsx and not need to ask the user this. they can change it on the larger preferences page later if they want to)
    
    
    ## User Interface components/things
    1 - simple sign up form - we get the users email address and the threshold price they want to be notified for.
    2 - confirmation email - we send a confirmation email to the user's email address, once they confirm their email address we update the user's status to active on the list. The user can then update their exact preferences.
    3 - preferences page - the user can update their exact preferences from this page, they can also unsubscribe from the list here.
    4 - unsubscribe link - the user can unsubscribe from the list from this page - but it will just take them to the preferences page.
    
    # Technologies
    
    We will use a hosted SMTP service to send the emails such as SendGrid, but we'll need the smtp details to configure this - they can be configured in the pricepergig-backend-webapi/webapi/EnvironmentVariables.cs file.
    
    We will use hangfire to handle the scheduling of the emails, this way we can 'fire and forget' and not have to keep the application running to send the emails as each time hangfire is started it will resume the emails job from where it left off.# Goal
    
    
    We want to send emails to users when they have certain thresholds of listings.
    
    
    # Features
    
    
    User's on the front end can subscribe to emails, at that point they choose the options they would like notifications for along with a price per TB or price per GB. threshold to be met.
    When the best price in that category is met, we send an email to the user with the listing details and link directly to the listing.
    
    
    We will store the users email address and preferences in a table.
    
    
    We need a front end for the user to manage their email preferences. 
    Users should have to double opt in / confirm their email address for it to become active on the list. 
    
    
    we should use the same react components for the user preferences as we do on the main site/subscribe component.
    
    
    we will also need a super simple front end looking component that takes just the user's email address. when a user enters their email address and a threshold price we should send that to the backend and store it in the database, then send the user a confirmation email, once the user confirms their email address we should update the user's status to active on the list. The user can then update their exact preferences.
    
    
    ## User preferences
    Users can choose from the following options to get notified for:
                ""nvme-m2"" - Cheapest NVMe M.2 SSD (any brand)
                ""nvme-m2-branded"" - Cheapest NVMe M.2 SSD (known branded)

And, this is my prompts, and if you read, you'll see, a good few prompts were because I had a file called EmailService already that didn't actually do anything other than send me one email each day so I knew the server was up and running.



1. update this file with the single storypoint tasks, make them a check list so that you can follow it later. you should read the codebase and make it clear what you can do - make a good PLAN you can execute later

1. Implement each of the # Single Storypoint Task in thsi file, you shoudl implement them and tick them off as you go. think hard, work methodically. complete the ENTIRE WORKLOAD - keep reminding yourself to look back at this task list and complete it.
2. the migration was created coontinue, you MUST update the Email list document tick boxes as you go

1. continue
2. hey, why don't you try building the back end and fixing the errors
3. try cd pricepergig-backend/webapi dotnet build
4. the problem is u/EmailService.cs and u/EmailService.cs I think the one in the utils folder should be renamed to EmailSenderService
5. ok, now run the new unit tests if you can, we've never done that before in here.
6. you don't need to mock them, just create them and use them and pass them in right? why mock something that dons't need mocking?
7. update this and write some simple instructions for me to test, e.g. i can't even 'see' the subscribe box
8. ok, you've used a new framework for api calls, axios . I think these api calls are simple, just use the native fetch apis go read u/App.tsx as to examples of us using this. now update your email code to use that on the front end so we don't need more libraries.
9. yeah do we need api.pricepergig.com? I don't know what that's about we always use 'baseurl'/api/ instead so can you follow the same, because otherwise that another domain to setup. perhaps you don't know how backened api is, it's just backend.pricepergig.com - api would have been better, but never mind, it's backend.pricepergig.com



I really need to get cursor to not go adding random frameworks, maybe a more complete # Technology section? How do you deal with that?

After you’ve exhausted your 500 monthly requests, you can enable usage-based pricing for premium models from cursor.com/settings which will allow you to pay $0.04 per request you use beyond the 500 monthly allotment. 

If you don’t enable usage-based pricing for premium models, you may be dropped into our slow pool after you make 500 requests. The slow pool activates when the platform is seeing high load and can result in a delay of seconds or even minutes to receive a response to each request. The more requests you make in the slow pool, the longer your wait time for the month can extend. 

Check out the Models page in our docs to see all of the models we offer and their pricing. Non-premium models that are not free require you to enable usage-based pricing and do not qualify for the 500 request allotment. For example, o1 is $0.40 per request.

I honestly think that one of the reasons why some people dislike the AI evolvement right now is because they find joy from the small details, from writing specific code. And this is OK - for personal projects or if it’s a demand that the code needs to be 100% perfect and follow all best practices. But in reality, most customers doesn’t care about these details. They want their software to solve their problems.

I wouldn’t let cursor generate as much code as I do if I were writing software for a bloody rocket or a self-driving vehicle where every single detail matters but that’s not what I do. That’s not what most people do. I’m so tired of people thinking that the software they create is revolutionary.

Commented above. Stop lashing out at the rest of the community and post actual evidence. I don't believe what you're saying at all, but it's definitely possible I'm wrong -- you're going to have to do more than tell me it doesn't feel like Sonnet to you though. This model *just* came out, people are still debating it's qualities right now, yet your confidence level in the vibe check is apparently enough for you to think this image is proof of something.

The name thing (what name the model gives) is what it is. I can go blue in the face repeating that this has always been an issue, and that the same behavior can be seen in other interfaces including Anthropic's own, but whatever. It's not wrong to include, but you have *got* to back this up with something more than a single generation (which looks fine to me). Even if I thought your generation looked sus, what would that prove? Think about it. The way any of these models respond is going to vary dramatically based on what they've been prompted with and the rest of the context. *At the very least*, you need to be posting full conversations if you want people to take this seriously. Frankly I think it's wrong of you to make these sorts of accusations without doing that from the onset.

1. Ask Cursor to create a shell script at your repo root that copies all repo content to clipboard in LLM-ready format

cline with my own API keys is still incredibly useful tool to have for really straightforward but ""bulky"" stuff needing large amounts of text. much cheaper than any other SaaS editor and works in cursor too so ya dont have to change anything, but Cursor has an incredibly well implemented agentic workflow that no one else has gotten close to. Cursor is more likely to figure out that its fucking up and fix itself, but it seemed to end up more expensive to be spamming vs windsurf, and much more than cline.

otherwise its like cursor >>>windsurf>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>copilot.

1j7wv39,A Deep Dive into Cursor Rules (> 0.45),"# Understanding Cursor Rules Deeply

Hi guys! After diving into Cursor 0.45’s Rules mechanism, I discovered that the official documentation is incomplete. It hints at certain concepts but doesn’t align with our intuition, leading to misunderstandings for beginners. This article provides an in-depth explanation of the Rules system and its principles. Feel free to discuss if you have questions.

# User Rules

User Rules define global preferences, like the desired tone, how the model addresses you, and principles for communication. These rules follow the editor and apply across all projects. User Rules are always sent to the AI in all chat sessions and conversations triggered by pressing Command-K.

# Project Rules

# Purpose

Project Rules are project-specific, designed to align with the needs of individual projects. Cursor organizes them as `.mdc` files in a structured system that automatically creates directories and files when new rules are added.

    └── .cursor
        └── rules
            ├── global.mdc
            └── only-html.mdc

An `.mdc` file is plain text with content that looks like this:

    ---
    description: Always apply in any situation
    globs: 
    alwaysApply: true
    ---
    
    When this rule loads, input: ""Rule loaded: global.mdc.""

# Editing Limitations

Cursor offers an integrated but buggy UI for editing `.mdc` files, which hasn’t been fixed yet. Editing these files with external tools like VSCode is recommended.

# Why Store Them in .cursor/rules/?

1. They integrate into the codebase.
2. Files in `.cursor` can be committed to Git repositories.
3. Teams can collaborate using shared rules, ensuring consistency as everyone pulls the same rules.

# How Do Project Rules Work?

* Do rules placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory automatically activate? **No.**
* Do the same rules apply equally across ask/edit/agent modes? **No.**

# Two Stages of Activation in Cursor

# Stage 1: Injection

Rules are injected into the system prompt context but aren’t yet active. Whether a rule is injected depends on:

1. `alwaysApply` : Injects the rule into the context unconditionally, but **does not control activation** .
2. `globs` : Matches files based on patterns (e.g., filenames, extensions). If matched, the rule is injected into the context. Again, this **does not control activation** .

# Stage 2: Activation

Whether a rule takes effect depends on its `description` field.

Cursor appends the following structure to the system prompt:

    <available_instructions>
    
    Cursor rules are user-provided instructions for the AI to follow to help work with the codebase.
    
    They may or may not be relevant to the task at hand. If they are, use the fetch_rules tool to fetch the full rule.
    
    Some rules may automatically attach to the conversation if the user links a file matching the rule's glob; those won't need to be fetched.
    
    # RULES_1.name: RULES_1.description
    
    # RULES_2.name: RULES_2.description
    
    </available_instructions>
    
    <cursor_rules_context>
    
    Cursor Rules are extra documentation provided by the user to help the AI understand the codebase.
    
    Use them if they seem useful to the user's most recent query, but do not use them if they seem unrelated.
    
    # RULES_1
    
    # RULES_2
    
    </cursor_rules_context>

That's the key prompt `Use them if they seem useful to the user's most recent query, but do not use them if they seem unrelated.`

# Key Points About Activation:

1. `description` : The `description` defines the appropriate scenarios, and the model will evaluate the context to decide whether the rule should be applied., such as:

* Always active in all situations.
* Active during planning discussions.
* Active for frontend projects.
* Etc.

1. **AI Intelligence Required** : The model must have sufficient intelligence to properly interpret the `description`. Less capable models (e.g., GPT-4-mini) may fail to understand and apply the rules effectively.

# Summary

For Project Rules to work as intended, you must understand how these parameters interact:

1. `alwaysApply` : Suitable for global rules.
2. `globs` : Matches files or directories based on naming patterns.
3. `description` : Determines activation during conversations by instructing the model through natural language.

Understanding these combinations ensures seamless rule integration in your workflows.",2025-03-10 04:55:18,80,13,0.98,cursor,WalrusCommercial4359,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j7wv39/a_deep_dive_into_cursor_rules_045/

mh0j7o4,,"Great info. I wonder what the best practice for `globs:` with regards to CLI commands. 

I initially had the following, without the `description`, `globs` and `alwaysApply` as part of a larger `.cursorrules` file, which worked. I'm trying to use the new format, which includes the `.cursor/rules` folder with mdc files:




    This project has three primary containers orchestrated by docker compose.

    ALL Django CLI commands should be preceded by `docker compose exec web`. For example:


    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```

    Becomes:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations
    ```

    All database commands should be preceded by `docker compose exec db`. For example:

    ```bash
    psql -U postgres my_project < db_backup.sql
    ```

    Becomes:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec db psql -U postgres my_project < db_backup.sql
    ```


    All Celery commands should be preceded by `docker compose exec celery`. For example:

    ```bash
    celery -A my_project worker -l info
    ```

    Becomes:

    ```bash

1itwarj,"Reflection of Cursor vs Windsurf. Normally I wouldn’t have tried Windsurf, but…","Guys, I have been switching over from cursor and there's a couple of things that are a little bit annoying me in my workflow:

1) Not being able to simply drag and drop the relevant files from the file tree into the Cascade/Chat.

2) Having no clear distinction of the chat and the cascade, whereas in cursor, I had those two nicely separated. So I had a nice separation of concerns there where I could blast off questions in unrelated topics on the chat side and then do feature buildouts via the composer side. That's something that I'm missing as well.

3) Sometimes when cascades builds something out and when I click to see the code it has written, it doesn't even highlight. So it was very hard to see what exactly changed

4) In cursor, the sidebar is actually sitting on top of the file tree explorer. Is there any way to change it back to the top like it is in cursor?  I feel like that part takes off a significant amount of screen real estate in a sense that it can cut off some file namings and I have to decrease my code view.



What I like about Windsurf:

1) Better clarity on the token usage.

2) The UI looks very clean and nice and the branding is growing on me.

3) Deepseek v3 free

4) minor aspects of the experience that makes you feel that they are much more polising the product, whereas it feels as cursor might be experiencing an increasing level of bureacracy.

5) Better pricing and high usage tier.




The reality of the matter is I wouldn't have even changed to Windsurf if it weren't for the deprecation of adding more fast requests to cursor. I actually only later saw that putting in your own API key would actually be almost the same cost as if it were for paying regular 500 requests, but that wasn't clearly communicated in their user experience (but then why depricate it?)

1. while cursor isn't great there, windsurf just isn't as well.   
2. agree on that while i don't care too much about it, cursor is good enough for me  
3. Couldn't care less, can't make it work properly - sonnet 3.5 is still king for me  
4. can't see where   
5. LOL no - have you ever worked with it? Token usage in cascade is enourmous especially if it decides to run through some bug fixing loops. Additionally you really need to take care to not break things easily in these runs.

You can absolutely use more fast requests on Cursor and it's even better - you don't have to buy them in packages but pay them one by one with the same price as in the packages before. Not sure what your complaint is here to be honest.

Overall for me Windsurf has some nice things over Cursor but below the line Cursor still works better for me.

Agent mode in cursor is so talented, can handle multiple tasks at the same time and will hit the wall with 25 requests.

In any case, I felt like this was so much of a problem that I've been building something to make MCP Servers more reliable. Dead simple one-time setup, connect all your tools through an easy interface, and it *just works*. 

The approach is to centralize MCP Servers to a single SSE endpoint, and focus on making the tool calls more reliable. How can we get cursor to call the right tool each time? How can we reduce the number of calls cursor needs to make to have the right context/parameters to call a specific tool? A lot of this requires doing smart things on the MCP server to make tool function caling more successful.

When you subscribe to the $20/month Pro plan, you can use your own API keys, but you'll likely find the best performance and pricing using the models provided by Cursor instead. Due to the volume we buy from these providers each month, we have much higher rate limits and lower pricing.

Check out the Models page in our docs for more details on what we offer and pricing: [https://docs.cursor.com/settings/models](https://docs.cursor.com/settings/models)

All models with a checkmark in the Premium column count against the 500 monthly requests that come with your Pro account. Once you've exhausted your 500 requests, we continue to serve these to you, but during peak periods you may be dropped into our slow pool, which can cause longer delays in receiving responses. If you want to avoid the slow pool and/or use non-Premium models that are not free, you can enable usage-based pricing from the Settings page at [https://www.cursor.com/settings](https://www.cursor.com/settings) and pay per request.

The more requests you make while in this pool, the longer your wait time will grow.

There are a couple ways to mitigate this. You can enable 'usage-based for premium models' from the account settings page at [https://www.cursor.com/settings](https://www.cursor.com/settings) which will allow you to purchase additional fast requests on a pay-as-you-go model. You set a budget and choose when to turn on or off this option, and you'll be guaranteed fast requests when it's enabled. You can also use a free model like cursor-small or deepseek-v3 which will allow you to avoid the slow pool. You can read more about models and their pricing at https://www.cursor.com/settings.

1jbe4wl,Cursor Chat Auto-Editing Files Without Permission – Anyone Else Experiencing This?,"I’ve been using Cursor heavily—8-12 hours a day—since last October, and after the recent forced update, I’ve noticed Cursor Chat (not Composer) is editing files it wasn’t prompted to edit. Even when I explicitly instruct it only to read the attached file and suggest a solution for me to review and apply manually, it still makes unwanted changes.

This has been a huge disruption, costing me a full day’s work trying to track down why things that were previously working are now breaking or behaving differently. I’ve disabled auto-apply, Composer’s agent mode, and every automation feature I can find, but the issue persists.

I had to manually revert to an earlier version of Cursor to avoid this. Has anyone else run into this?

mfgntr2,,"Claude 3.7 in Cursor is eager — sometimes a bit too eager. Like a programmer who's had one espresso too many. Sure, the code works, but often at the cost of unnecessary complexity — adding extra if-statements ""just in case,"" even when simpler patterns would suffice.

Some might call this ""defensive programming."" Perhaps folks from the Java world even appreciate this style. I prefer to call it ""unnecessary bloat."" Yes, it might boost the percentage of working code (and thus look better in benchmarks), but complexity matters — a lot. Not just for aesthetics (though I admit holding the minority view that clean code is valuable in itself), but because overly complex code makes future changes harder and more error-prone, whether done manually or by Claude 3.7 itself.

For example, I asked Claude to move CSS into a separate file instead of embedding it in a Python string. It did exactly that—but then, just to be safe, also inlined the CSS anyway.

Another common pattern: when I request removing unnecessarily long imports, Claude often hesitates, leaving them in place ""just in case."" Unfortunately, this happens frequently.
