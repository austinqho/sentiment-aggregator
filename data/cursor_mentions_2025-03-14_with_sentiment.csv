In terms of statistics: Since September of 2023, the site has consistently seen over 160,000,000 (160 MILLION) mod archives downloaded per month ***for Skyrim Special Edition alone***—[and if you want other stats, site-wide statistics (and per-game statistics) are public.](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/stats).

1ivnr42,I'm a Product Designer who built a Price Comparison platform frontend in 32 hours with Cursor+Claude,"# Introduction

Hey everyone! 👋 I’ve been working on a **comprehensive shopping experienc**e in the form of a **price comparison** platform called [PricePilot](https://trypricepilot.com/)**.**

**It's been designed** to help shoppers discover products efficiently, compare product information side-by-side, and then help compare prices across multiple retailers. As a solo founder, I wanted to share my journey, the challenges I faced, and the tech stack I used.

***BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER:*** *To be transparent as my post is catching the ire of some users, the total time spent on the frontend is at about* ***\~80hrs or so***. The 32 hours I had added in the post title was seeing how fast I could go live with a basic ecommerce frontend which included a search experience, product listings and details page, and full responsiveness.

# Pain Points That Led to PricePilot

Shopping online should be simple, but:

* Finding the best price often means opening multiple tabs and checking different retailers manually.
* Many comparison sites feel outdated, cluttered, or don’t include key product details and features.
* Many platforms prioritize affiliate revenue over a clean UX

I wanted to build something better—**fast, user-friendly, and helpful.**

# How PricePilot Solves These Issues

✅ **Clear, simple UI** and **lightning-fast search** designed for usability  
✅ **Side-by-side product information comparisons** to help you easily compare the differences in price, ratings, and specifications  
✅ **Side-by-side price comparisons** across multiple retailers so you don't have to find the product on each site

*Note: For the moment, we only show US retailers but plan to expand to Canada and perhaps elsewhere once we get everything figured out for the US audience.*

# Tech Stack

💻 **Frontend**: Vercel + Next.js + Typescript + Tailwind CSS + Typesense (Search)  
🛠 **Backend:** Supabase, Python+Playwright+BS4 for web scraping, Node for getting info from APIs and product feeds

# Would Love Your Thoughts!

I’m actively working on improving **search, filtering, and UX optimizations**. Additionally working on getting many more products for you to shop for. If you’re interested in price comparison tools, I’d love your feedback! 🙌

1j4prw6,My (Hopeful) Cursor Redemption Arc.,"This past week, I posted on this subreddit about a silly problem that didn’t really need to be fixed—but I’m glad I did. Turns out the custom cursor trail I spent hours fiddling with, which I thought was the coolest thing about my website, actually sucked. And boy, did you guys not hold back. But I’m so glad I got grilled on my terrible cursor—it was distracting and overall just not great.

I decided to channel this energy into creating something new. So, I completely scrapped the old code and started from scratch. I created two new iterations, trying to incorporate as much of everyone's feedback as possible.

From this link, you’ll find three videos: one of my original cursor effect, one that’s a bit Stronger with the Ink, little darker and more rugged, and another that’s watercolor-inspired with some nice light diffusion. It would mean the world to me if, once again, you all were kind enough to lay into me and tell me what sucks. I tried to take in all the feedback I received, and any pointers would also be amazing!

1ix6qqr,Experimenting with an AI-Driven CMS Alternative (v0 + Cursor),"I recently tested a workflow that ditches traditional CMS options for an AI-driven approach. By combining [v0](https://github.com/volta-cli/v0) for deployment and Cursor (an AI code generator) for content creation, I managed to streamline my publishing process without the usual overhead of a large CMS or database.

In my blog post, I explain how I containerized everything, used AI to generate updates, and quickly deployed changes. It’s quite different from WordPress or a typical headless CMS, but I found it flexible and surprisingly straightforward to maintain.

I recent times, I've been looking to try different code editors just to try them out. Jetbrains, even nvim. 

But I've noticed that across these other editors, my favourite theme is no-where to be found. And I was quite surprised by how much effect your colour scheme has on your ability to quickly parse and find code.

Are there a collection of big name colour schemes that have lots of integrations? Not even just with code editors but maybe the terminal itself? I love a unified look, and that's the solution I'm going for.

## Things to considerate:
1. Both the index.html and store.html links only script.js

2. opening the store.html and refreshing it 2-3 times gives this console error:
```txt
Error: Error fetching data: 
TypeError {}
message: ""Failed to fetch""
stack: ""TypeError: Failed to fetch↵ at window.fetch (http://localhost:8158/mguxb9xw_console.js:8:221620)↵ at fetchData (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:13:28)↵ at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:21:9)↵ at http://localhost:8158/script.js:4:1""
get stack: ƒ ()
set stack: ƒ ()
[[Prototype]]: Object
```
3. Open store.html and adding items in store.html and when I refresh the page 2-3 times it gives this error: and I cant add any items after that
```txt
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
at http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:55:25
at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
at renderCartItems (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:47:16)
at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:22:3)
```
4. Clearing the localStorage and trying does not solve any problem

5. I threw both my code and errors at AI tools for help, but instead of fixing the bug, we both ended up more confused—now it feels like the AI is debugging me!

",2025-03-06 04:39:20,0,5,0.33,webdev,koko-hranghlu,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1j4ujan/i_have_problems_working_with_asyncawait_and_local/,"I have problems working with async/await and local json file. I have been debugging and smashing my head on table for the past 24 hours! ## My folder structure:
```txt

## Things to considerate:
1. Both the index.html and store.html links only script.js

2. opening the store.html and refreshing it 2-3 times gives this console error:
```txt
Error: Error fetching data: 
TypeError {}
message: ""Failed to fetch""
stack: ""TypeError: Failed to fetch↵ at window.fetch (http://localhost:8158/mguxb9xw_console.js:8:221620)↵ at fetchData (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:13:28)↵ at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:21:9)↵ at http://localhost:8158/script.js:4:1""
get stack: ƒ ()
set stack: ƒ ()
[[Prototype]]: Object
```
3. Open store.html and adding items in store.html and when I refresh the page 2-3 times it gives this error: and I cant add any items after that
```txt
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
at http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:55:25
at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
at renderCartItems (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:47:16)
at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:22:3)
```
4. Clearing the localStorage and trying does not solve any problem

5. I threw both my code and errors at AI tools for help, but instead of fixing the bug, we both ended up more confused—now it feels like the AI is debugging me!

1j6d84j,Best AI for Programming (2025-03),"Hey all, I've been using free-tier AI tools pretty intensively over the past few months to support my work and daily life. About 70% of my usage is for programming, and the rest is for other stuff. I’ve been jumping between tools like ChatGPT, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Deepseek—mostly because one of them is usually down or hits its limit when I need it.

Recently, I discovered Lovable dev (along with similar options like Bolt and v0) and gave it a try—pretty impressive stuff 😅. Now I'm feeling a bit stuck on which one is really worth upgrading to a paid subscription.

Any thoughts or suggestions? Also, if anyone’s got a setup that mixes two or more free AIs or even self-hosting options (whether on your own hardware or a rented server), I'm all ears.

1ini225,AI Usage in IDE's,"I'm sure this has been beaten to death, but let's give it another go.

I use several IDE's and one thing they all share is a thriving AI ecosystem. From JetBrains to VSCode the drive to AI is hard to ignore. That  VSCode-->Copilot-->GitHub workflow is really something and keeps getting better.

Codeium, Cursor and such only make it easier and as open source models emerge and costs come down it's only going to get more common.

Being able to say, ""Using DDEV, create a directory, make a database and clone this repo into it then run the install script "" and have it all work is freakin' magic. Telling my editor to make a change, say to rename something, throughout my entire codebase is trivial and I can say it in plain English. Most of the time it's just fancy find&replace, but it's almost always better formatted and commented than I would do alone. I don't even have to mess with Prettier and linters.

I can feed this thing specific docs. I'm not a smart man, there are many docs that I find impenetrable and many more that I constantly Google. Relating those docs to the codebase that I'm working in purely amazing -- I can find out anything. Right where I actually need it.

Sure, sometimes it goes horribly wrong, but this is why it's in IDE's to start with. A baseline knowledge is assumed -- .cursorrules and context are not trivial if you want them to work.

1itinty,Loading screen question,"I got a working loading that is almost to my personal favorite. I just need to change the cursor color to gold. And the ring colors around. But I was wondering what should I do about the amount of times it shows up.

I currently have it so that it loads every time a user goes to the homepage. It's great. And I want to add a purposeful delay. Like make the screen 3 seconds long for the whole thing to work. And since the ring is already pulsing, make the text under it do the same.

But I was wondering if I should only have it once when someone goes into the website for the first time or should I just keep it so ita will always show up whenever a user goes to the homepage from any tab in my website?

Addition: I am just making a portfolio/personal website. I'm making this becuase there a few elements in the script takes maybe a second or two. I am adjusting the loading to be quick. And I have a fading animation for when the loading is done.

1j56ju8,I Built a Footnotes Plugin for Summernote – Looking for Feedback!,"Hey r/webdev,

I recently built and published a **Footnotes plugin** for the **Summernote WYSIWYG editor**, and I’d love to get your thoughts on it! 🎉

🔹 **What It Does:**

* Lets you insert **footnotes** at the cursor position.
* Automatically adds them to the end of the editor’s content.

🔹 **Why I Built It:**  
I noticed that Summernote doesn’t have a built-in footnotes feature, and manually handling footnotes can be frustrating, especially for blogs, academic content, or articles. So, I decided to create a plugin to solve this problem.

🔹 **Check it out here:**  
👉 **GitHub:** [https://github.com/ahmadyousefdev/summernote-footnotes](https://github.com/ahmadyousefdev/summernote-footnotes)

I’d really appreciate any **feedback, feature suggestions, or bug reports**! Let me know if this is something you’d use or if you have ideas for improvement. 🚀

1j0bvk2,AI Code Assistant Demos,"I think tools like Cursor and Copilot are nice. They haven’t been useful or reliable enough to revolutionize my workflow, but they certainly keep me from bouncing around Stack Overflow.

I just find the messaging around these tools to be a little bizarre. There is almost a late night infomercial vibe to it all. 

“Throw all your knives away! You only need this one!”

I saw a post by someone who works at a VP level raving over a demo where someone cloned an app using some AI tool. He then trash talked the “old school” way of building software with scrum teams and dozens of devs.

It was very disappointing, and alarming to see a post like that, because I feel he should know better. Imagine working as a welder, and your boss walks in and says, “I saw a commercial where this guy put an entire boat together using this stuff called Flex Seal. All he had to do was spray it on.

1j9196v,"I didn't want to go, but PyCharm finally drove me into the arms of VSCode, after 5+ years.","I just switched to VSCode after well over five years with PyCharm. I didn't want to do it, but I just can't stand it anymore.

**Things I love about PyCharm and will miss**

1. The refactoring functionality. VSCode's Python extension has that too, but it isn't as nice. 

At this point, that's pretty much it.

**Things that drove me nuts**

1. IdeaVim. It actually got better recently, but for years and years, the undo function was busted, so you had to hit `u` over and over to undo what in real vim is a single operation. VSCode's neovim plugin uses actual neovim under the hood, which is obviously so much more robust and faithful, while IdeaVim will never be a full implementation.
2. The gradual accumulation of simple bugs that never get fixed.
3. It's so slow. I didn't appreciate just how slow until I switched over to VSCode. I mean, holy crap, it's 10x faster for a lot of things (opening a project, installing or restarting extensions, for example).

Here are the bugs that have bugged me the worst:

The ""usages"" window (cmd-click on a definition, see where it's used) constantly resizes itself too small. It's been a problem for years. They won't fix the way autosize works, OR let us turn it off. Plus you have to get your mouse cursor nearly pixel-perfect to resize it yourself, so you can see the whole code preview. Then the very next time you use it, it's back to its stupidly narrow size.

**Type inference is busted.** 

If you do something as standard as this, you get a type error on `f`, saying ""Expected type 'SupportsWrite[bytes]', got 'BufferedWriter' instead"":

    with open(filename, ""wb"") as f:
        pickle.dump(obj, f)

And I can't just disable the ""unexpected type"" code inspection--it's probably the single most valuable one. So I'm stuck with a lot of my files showing warnings that shouldn't be there. Which also keeps me from using the keyboard shortcut to bounce to any real problem of a lower severity.

If you're doing a comprehension inside a class method, and you name the iteration variable the same as a class attribute (e.g., you have `myclass.name`, and you do a comprehension like `[ ... for name in names]`, then the inferred type of the iteration variable overwrites the inferred type of the class attribute. This makes no sense--`name` and `self.name` have nothing to do with one another. This one is easy enough to work around by appending an underscore to the iteration variable's name, but it indicates something is very wrong under the hood.

There are several more specific type inference problems in my codebase, where my method clearly returns `MyType`, but PyCharm infers it as `MyType | None` and throws a warning. The method cannot possibly return `None`, and `mypy` agrees with me. So I'm stuck with another spurious warning.

These problems just never, ever get fixed, and they keep on accruing. Add it to the fact that JetBrains IDE's are always second in line for addon support, and I just couldn't justify sticking with it.

Thanks for coming to my talk, sorry I went over time.

> i really don't understand why wouldnt just adapt to modern keyboard shortcuts.

It's not about the keyboard shortcuts. Most of them don't even change if you use vim mode instead of standard editing--only the very few that conflict with a standard vim keystroke like ctrl-R for redo.

**You're not giving up any of the IDE's features whatsoever--they all remain available to you, and almost all of them remain relevant. Vim mode just changes the way you interact with the code while editing.**

It's not about renaming variables, either. I'd never do that with a vim command when the IDE will do it for me as needed in all files, and knows *not* to do it when the same name is used in different contexts.

It's just that once you get comfortable with it, it's *fluid* in a way that's hard to describe. For instance, if I've got six lines of code that I want to move up by twelve lines. With standard editing, I'd have to grab the mouse, or do a bunch of arrow-shift-arrow stuff. 

But in vim mode, it'll be something like `d6j12kp`. (And no, you don't have to count the lines--that's what ""relative line numbering"" is for!) Just moving around is better. If you want to go up 30 lines to do something, you don't grab the mouse or reach for an arrow key and hold it down, you just say `30k` and you're there. You're probably thinking about your next edit on the way, maybe even typing it without a pause. It's like a little language. It's efficient, and it's *fun*.

If I want to change a list comprehension to a set comprehension, then it's just `cs]}` with my cursor anywhere inside the comprehension. Enclose the rest of a line inside a function call, e.g., `var = foo` to `var = str(foo)`? It's `ys$fstr<enter>`. Now, that's not better than `str(`<end>`)`, but...

*Any* editing operation you've just done can be repeated with the `.` key. So if I've been doing that thing with `str(foo)` and I need to do it a few more times, it's probably just `n.n.n.` (next match, repeat command).

 I'm not saying those commands are intuitive if you're new to it, because they aren't. But imagine if it *was* second nature, how fast and comfortable it would be, to do everything so quickly without ever taking your fingers off the home row.

Does a calculator make you feel inadequate with its math knowledge and effortless computation speed? The answer to both should be yes. But that's fine, your job isn't to memorize and write the best code, your job is to do your job. Instead of an entry level code monkey, you're now a junior architect who is giving instructions to an ai code monkey, congratulations!

My advice is to get good at reading code and giving feedback. You don't want to let ai make any decisions on its own, that's how you get bad or even dangerous results. It might appear to perfectly understand simple problem domains but when it comes to solving business problems it might make an assumption that is the opposite of what you need or includes a fatal miscalculation. A good way to ensure the ai doesn't make too many decisions is to write or request that it writes stubs/signatures only and then put comments in the function body to precisely guide what it will create.

I shill it so much I feel like I should be paid to do so, but I'd also like to mention windsurf. If your company is already set with a dozen licenses or enterprise setup for cursor then so be it, but I enjoyed windsurf as an alternative for an ai integrated ide that can be instructed to code. I don't know what it does better or worse than cursor, but it's good to know what your options are.

Edit: oops, forgot to answer the question. Why learn? If it's your passion to compete with the calculator then keep practicing and you will get better.

If you want my suggestion, I can give you some tips:

\* Stick to classic learning approach, don't try to hurry or jump from one thing to other, be patient everything is fine.

\* As you told me that you are still learning so I will suggest you that don't take help from Chat-GPT or Cursor. Try to read from documentation, when you learn from documentation you will learn many more topic . when you think you are fully confident and there is nothing to learn more there, then you can take help from chat-GPT to save your time and make work easier.

1ird6g1,Experiencing Algorithms Skill Issues and Not Sure How To Get Good,"Please let me know if there is a diff subreddit I should post this in!

First things first: I am in my first intro to algos class and after looking at my grades... I am doomed. I am fundamentally missing something and cannot figure out for the life of me why I am so pathetically bad at this.

For one, I have like a decent amount of experience programming; I've done a handful of beginner projects, and generally feel like I can explain fundamental concepts (abstraction/classes/etc) decently enough, but when I go to code this intense sense of dread and stupidity washes over me and I feel immense pain, frustration, and self hatred every time I do it.

Now, in this course, this sense of frustration and impatience has just officially hit its peak. I am missing pretty much every deadline because I procrastinate so much, and when I do hit the deadlines, I either don't recurse enough times in something or I am using dynamic arrays when they want me to use static arrays, etc. and I am just losing it. While I understand procrastination does not help, there is nothing I would rather avoid than doing a CS project while in the midst of my other more interesting EE-focused classes, and I also just like. Hate it.

One great example is this palindrome detector I'm trying to build. I know in and out how this problem should go, the whole vector of vectors structure I want to use, what my recursive functions are going to do, what their base cases should be, what helper functions I need, what edge cases I want to check for, and yet here I sit, gazing on my VSCode terminal with a completely blank .cpp file and my cursor blinking at me menacingly. Like everything is there in my head but actually putting it down I have so many things I need to start I don't even know where to begin.

In the past, I've tried writing pseudocode, and that helps a little, but I always end up with a pile of awful horrible bugs that make me feel incredibly discouraged, and I've tried starting with smaller functions, but I always find myself going back and forth from unit tests and getting so caught up in writing test cases that the actual code part itself is the last thing I want to do when I've adequately created 1-2 working functions.

It also hurts that in lecture, etc a lot of these concepts download pretty quickly and feel digestible. I really like conceptually concocting solutions to problems and feel comfortable explaining and figuring out where specific data structures are most optimal. Not a single \*written\* assignment has been difficult for me, it is literally just programming.

Now that I'm done whining, here come the questions: how do I overcome this skill issue? Is there a particular resource that will help me build my programming muscle, and if so, is that what is fundamentally missing here? I've heard LeetCode is pretty good, but nobody I talk to can really speak to its value as they haven't really needed it (they just good like that I guess). I'm considering trying it out because in other problem-solving/design-oriented classes, I largely benefit from doing a massive volume of practice problems, but if there is a resource that is better, I would love some insight. Additionally, how do I avoid the testing trap where I find myself just focusing on writing test cases and neglect the actual progress I'm trying to make?

I am still safe to pass if I make a drastic enough change and really refocus my energy, but I need to get on that ASAP if I want to actually do decently well in the course.

First things first: I am in my first intro to algos class and after looking at my grades... I am doomed. I am fundamentally missing something and cannot figure out for the life of me why I am so pathetically bad at this.

For one, I have like a decent amount of experience programming; I've done a handful of beginner projects, and generally feel like I can explain fundamental concepts (abstraction/classes/etc) decently enough, but when I go to code this intense sense of dread and stupidity washes over me and I feel immense pain, frustration, and self hatred every time I do it.

1j7c5qa,Software engineer who is bad at planning,"I’m a software engineer who is bad at planning. 

Ways in which this affects me:
- Writing design docs bores me. I would rather prototype and learn as I do. Though I do see benefit of designing to ensure requirements are clear, evaluate trade-offs, and prevent wasted efforts / inefficient solutions. I see the benefit. I just don’t enjoy writing them as much. I like to do. 
- It’s difficult for me to estimate the ETA of a task. I’d rather just work on two important tasks in parallel and try to finish both as quickly as possible. When I am blocked on one, I work on the other. 
- And I’m worried that Cursor/Copilot AI is going to automate me, and I don’t really have any career plan here when that happens. 


Can anyone relate? Does anyone have any advice?

Currently I just try to work with good planners and shower them with a lot of appreciation (though let’s be real, good planners are already highly rewarded in every workplace and industry).

1jaygyy,Learn JavaScript or soon obsolete with AI tools?,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently exploring startup ideas, mainly around web applications, and I have a big question about learning to code.

With the rise of platforms like Lovable, Bolt, Cursor, and Supabase, which speed up MVP development using vibe coding, is it still worth spending months learning JavaScript?

Honestly, I don’t want to invest 3–4 months learning it only to realize that in 6 months or a year, my skills are already outdated because these tools make development much faster, even for non-advanced coders. Is JavaScript still a valuable asset in this context, or should I focus on Python instead (especially for AI and back-end development)?

I also feel like AI integration has become almost mandatory for standing out in today’s startup world. For those who have launched a project, do you think it’s essential, or can a well-designed product still succeed without AI?

Lastly, if any of you have built a startup without technical skills or a network of developers, I’d love to hear your experience. How did you overcome that challenge?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and advice!",2025-03-14 00:36:42,0,4,0.22,learnprogramming,Flashy-Ad-5103,True,Reddit (r/learnprogramming),https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jaygyy/learn_javascript_or_soon_obsolete_with_ai_tools/,"Learn JavaScript or soon obsolete with AI tools?

I'm supposed to make a game in windows forms and I chose a top down shooter. I created a script to rotate a weapon around the player depending on where the mouse cursor is but now I need to rotate the weapon around itself so it always faces the curser.

1j92dpo,Can't remove bottom white space on horizontally sliding sections.,"Hello,

I've been scratching my head with this one for a bit - I am also not good at programming. I'm trying to create a portfolio website and I have a gallery on one of the pages. I have a fixed header with navigation elements in them that 'slide' horizontally between certain galleries on said page, they are: ""all"", ""macro"", ""marine"", and ""birdlife"".

  
I have four galleries but I'm focusing on ""all"" and ""macro"" for now. The problem is that ""all"" has more images in its gallery so it makes the page a lot longer - which creates a lot of white space under ""macro"". I have been trying to find a way to reduce this white space but I'm a bit stumped.

  
'Margin' and 'padding' don't work and neither do 'max-height'/'min-height'. I'm a bit worried that there isn't a solution as I realise all of these galleries are on the same page and thus have the same height no matter what.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I've been scratching my head with this one for a bit - I am also not good at programming. I'm trying to create a portfolio website and I have a gallery on one of the pages. I have a fixed header with navigation elements in them that 'slide' horizontally between certain galleries on said page, they are: ""all"", ""macro"", ""marine"", and ""birdlife"".

  
I have four galleries but I'm focusing on ""all"" and ""macro"" for now. The problem is that ""all"" has more images in its gallery so it makes the page a lot longer - which creates a lot of white space under ""macro"". I have been trying to find a way to reduce this white space but I'm a bit stumped.

  
'Margin' and 'padding' don't work and neither do 'max-height'/'min-height'. I'm a bit worried that there isn't a solution as I realise all of these galleries are on the same page and thus have the same height no matter what.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

1ize0ag,Best free alternative of Cursor in VSC with local setup with LM Studio,"Hi,

I would like your opinion on which tool to use to replace Cursor. I like how Cursor works, but I don't want to pay to access all the available features. I have a PC on which I run LM Studio with a Deepseek or Qwen model and I would like to use this instead of the online models via API, so I don't pay for the use because I run it locally. 

I would like to use VSC with some plugin that can connect to my machine with LM Studio and that can replicate the same functions as Cursor. For the functions I would like to have both the suggestions and the autocompletion, but above all the Composer (that function that allows me to create things from scratch starting from a description given in the chat).

1imxyz2,Internal debate on using AI while coding,"This is not a question as much as its a prompt to hear how others have experienced the transition between coding #raw into coding with an assistant, such as Cursor IDE or Github Copilot

I am 1 year 3 months into working in industry as a frontend engineer, coding mostly with Tanstack/React.

I told myself I needed to work 1 year full time before downloading an AI assistant to give myself a solid foundation. As mentioned, that period was up 3 months ago, when I downloaded Cursor and have been using it since. (A flawed idea? probably)

I have undeniably realized some pretty noticeable productivity gains in development, both in code quality and speed. That said, I can feeeeel myself becoming an idiot. Things I would usually have had to dig into have become a prompt and accept with quick review. Not to mention, I can design an entire system using a concept that I only kind of understand, if I was to switch to a normal editor or try to explain it to a coworker, I will not be able to do it at nearly the depth that maybe I should? It feels wrong but the question remains in my mind as this. 

Do I:

**A) Revert to not using AI, slowly progressing at the risk of not leveraging the 2025 toolset that is increasingly geared towards AI, but really understand what tf I am doing.**

  
or

  
**B) Trust that AI code assistants are not going anywhere and lean into using it becoming a faster and more immediately effective.**   
  
Every once in a while I will get stuck on a problem, furiously prompting, like an addict just begging my computer to spit out the correct answer, which ultimately is such a less gratifying experience than struggling through it on my own. 

I know the answer to this question is ""depends on your goals"" or ""usage within reason is the answer"". 

But in general: @ people who have been coding with AI for longer than 3 months - do you consider yourself a more capable engineer? Are you often caught up with below surface level problems? Have you reverted back to a normal IDE and found many of the skills transfer, or is it really you now cannot code at nearly the same level without the assistant?

* Actually understanding your tech stack choices (not just guessing)
* Auto-updating as your codebase evolves

mg3zkjy,,"This is like creating md files, with specific instructions  
For Example,  
You create [ProjectStructure.md](http://ProjectStructure.md) , [Objectives.md](http://Objectives.md), [Guidelines.md](http://Guidelines.md), [Coding.md](http://Coding.md), [Frontend.md](http://Frontend.md), [backend.md](http://backend.md), [check.md](http://check.md)

You will mainly use [check.md](http://check.md)  
in there  
""ALWAYS"" means -> checking each content of every md file in detail without missing out any content

then say   
Always check  [ProjectStructure.md](http://ProjectStructure.md) , before creating any new file, and also update it before implementing the last file during composing.

Always use [Frontend.md](http://Frontend.md), if you are creating and detected editing a front end file.

Always use, check, and update [Objectives.md](http://Objectives.md) once implementing current and the next steps.  
........  
and this goes on ...............  
  
the good thing about this, is that you could create your own custom instructions based on the project, once you already used this once in the project, although it might not work at first, but you could improve it based on your own requirements  
  
for example, i had [Error.md](http://Error.md) file, i told cursor to always add linter errors, or any other errors that i paste for it solve in the  [Error.md](http://Error.md) file and how it solved it, it did not automatically add until i had to mention about it, or you could even write a run a script, for this.

I think memory is already there, its just based on instructions to add to train in more based on a user's requirement, because other's do not even need rules because of the way the do the prompting, which is very important, the way you word it makes a big difference, not just normal English.

Maybe you could create an Extension to install in Cursor about logging and learning from this Errors, like whatever the project you could use that log  
for example it would usually   
\-sometimes install uncompatible dependencies.  
\-keep { } in import statements that do not need.  
\-Typescript coding style errors,

So you could accumulate this, tell cursor to always check this log before implementing files, so that it could learn, I am sure this will reduce the struggles. 

Maybe another once would implementation style  
For example  
\-It implements modules that have not been installed yet, whereby it should first install all necessary modules then implement the files  
  
\-sometimes it suggests to use a library but that library does not support certain implementation style or variable, which causes alot of errors, whereby it should first check the requirement of your project, then check a library to is flexible supports our implementation requirements. 

Although some might argue that they still create completed projects without any of the above, but it would still better for a user to have there personal memory that there own cursor could use during implementations.  
  
  
Maybe there might be someone has created, but i dont think if its 100% functional meaning that cursor always uses and follows it during the implementations, i think some it might be there but cursor does not fetch it sometimes, and just goes based on its own LLM implementations, And we cant force it follow the memory but use, learn then implement, which should be done.",2025-03-04 23:12:41,3,0,0.0,cursor,[deleted],False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j3v1zi/i_built_a_cursor_extension_that_actually/mg3zkjy/,"This is like creating md files, with specific instructions

Make sure that components work together with expected insouts When creating a models for parsing json, look up the api response or sample code or the sdk documentation directly, and use that as a reference, do not guess. Before creating a class or a file, perform a search on the codebase, and check the memlogdirectory_tree for any previous implementations and utilize those. Never create unnecessary duplicate files. Validate all the tests and the builds to ensure correctness. All targets must pass. Never open or interact with the xcode GUI. Only use command line interface.

*How It Works:*

*Creates a .cursorrules file containing your project's architecture decisions*



*Auto-updates as your codebase evolves*



*Maintains awareness of file relationships and dependencies*



*Understands your tech stack choices and coding patterns*



*Integrates with git to track meaningful changes*

mgami5w,,"Hi Nick, Cursor is definitely the tool I would love to keep working with.

However, we should identify ways to ensure that it is able to use Sonnet (as it seems like other models do not even exist :D ) in the most powerful and efficient way possible.

I thought it was just a gimmick. But turns out, dictating prompts for Cursor works super well and a lot faster than typing.

It lets me articulate longer prompts without breaking flow and it’s easier describing logical flows. Apparently 3x faster on average compared to typing. For example, dictating a complex API query prompt now takes seconds of braindumping with my voice instead of minutes.

I made a review of all the tools I’ve tested so y’all don’t have to waste money like I did:

Apple Dictation

* Pros: Free and built into macOS.
* Cons: Doesn’t get any technical terms right and ignores punctuation. Fine for a short message, useless for actual accuracy. It also breaks my flow waiting for the words to load in.

Willow Voice

* Pros: Formats paragraphs, adds punctuation intuitively, and handles my filler words. Accuracy and latency are very good.
* Cons: Subscription model, so whatever I pay for it

Aiko

* Pros: Offline and based locally so that I can trust it.
* Cons: No auto-formatting. Latency isn’t as good as other AI tools. My Mac’s fans sound like a jet engine during long sessions.

Dragon NaturallySpeaking

* Pros: Pretty much just legacy at this point
* Cons: It’s abandoned on Mac. Buggy, expensive, and stuck in 2010. Can’t believe I paid hundreds to try this.

Anyone else tried voice coding? Curious if others have workflows or tool tips to share.

It’s way too eager, constantly trying to do stuff in the code even when you don’t ask it to.

It also ignores rules - like if you say DRY, KISS, and YAGNI, it still keeps overthinking.

It straightup ignores serious linter errors and always overengineers everything. It also ignores rules like if you say DRY, KISS, and YAGNI, it still keeps overthinking. It hyperfocuses on some problem, overanalyzes it, and immediately tries to fix it. And that sucks. Spent the whole day with 3.7 yesterday, and by the evening, I was back to 3.5.

**New Features**

* **Chat/Composer Unification:** We heard your feedback and have unified Chat, Composer and Agent into a single interface. Switch between modes as your needs change with each task during your session.
* **UI Glow Up:** Our new unified chat interface includes several design improvements to de-clutter the UI and improve your flow. Three new themes designed for the Cursor UI are now available. To select a theme, go to Settings > Theme > Color Theme in the Cursor menu.
* **Agent Web Access:** Agent now proactively searches the web to find information when needed without having to include \`@web\` in your prompts.
* **Secure .cursorignore:** New security rules ensure that files listed in .cursorignore are never shared with LLMs or seen by Cursor. The new .cursorindexignore file supports the previous ignore functionality that only limits files from indexing.
* **Agent Tool Limit:** When reaching the 25 tool call limit, the Agent now displays a button to continue beyond this limit with a single click. Bypassing the limit consumes an extra request.
* **New MCP Features:** MCP gains new features like Yolo mode, the ability to configure Project Servers with .cursor/mcp.json, and the ability for Agent to use MCP resources as context.
* **Improved Project Rules:** A visual indicator is now shown anytime a rules set is applied to a request, and rules can now be applied globally.
* **Claude 3.7 Sonnet:** Support for our newest Premium models from Anthropic, Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking - both enabled for Agent.

**Fixes**

* **Crash Fixes:** Several memory, performance and reliability improvements.
* **MCP Fixes**: Reliability and quality of life fixes to make building MCP servers in Cursor even better.
* **Windows Fixes**: 
   * Fixed newline error in Chat Codeblocks
   * Resolve issue with Cursor uninstalling itself",2025-02-24 11:14:06,258,124,0.99,cursor,NickCursor,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1ixa7r3/introducing_cursor_046/,"Introducing Cursor 0.46! This week we’re unveiling our latest major release, Cursor 0.46!

1j8qb1f,An ex-Visual Studio engineer's thoughts on Cursor,"We first introduced code completion (one of our marketing ""wizards"" named it *IntelliSence*) for Visual Studio in 1996. The way we figured out ""what came next"" back then wouldn't even remotely be thought of as ""AI"" by modern standards. Most of the ""magic"" relied heavily on lightweight background compilers to figure out things like, ""What existing variable names can be placed here that would compile cleanly?""

I eventually left MS to join the Xcode team at Apple. In total, I spent 16 years helping to create tools aimed specifically at software engineers. In that time I learned a great deal about how people of all experience levels interact with these types of tools.

Why the history lesson? Because back then there were ""purist"" developers who absolutely refused to enable features like IntelliSense. A lot of the initial feedback was, ""Real developers write their own code! You're going to turn developers into idiots!"" And remember, all we were really doing back then was suggesting the next variable or displaying possible parameters for a function.

I retired a few years ago and now spend a ton of my time volunteering to help individuals and startups solve technical problems. I still write code every day.

After two solid months of very slowly incorporating Cursor into my workflow I am 100% sold on its functionality. I constantly bump into experienced developers who are in the anti-Cursor camp until I show them how I use the tool. I'm not a ""vibe coder"" (what a ridiculous term) by any means but there have been countless times I had an idea for a feature that I let Cursor take a few shots at. In one instance it chose an algorithm I was unfamiliar with and worked perfectly. I love the freedom of being able to try out even crazy ideas in a frictionless, risk free, and timely manner.

It is awesome seeing VS Code being used in this way. It took over a *decade* to convince the company that a ""baby"" version of Visual Studio would be useful and I'm so glad to see that decision pay off.

The days of ""LLMs can't code"" are over. Anyone who bothers to take a deep dive understands that. Do we still need to ensure the code is correct? Of course... but that is true of code written by even the most experienced human engineer. I don't implicitly trust *anyone's* code. ;-) 

 That said, I would absolutely love to see models that are trained on real-world debugging scenarios. VS Code has some incredibly useful debugging facilities that Cursor should be able to integrate with directly. For example, if I stop at a breakpoint Cursor should be able to inspect the callstack and automatically examine the code at previous levels to determine if a bug happened earlier in the code execution, detect race conditions, etc. Anyone who has wasted days trying to track down complex threading/deadlock issues would love these types of features.

mh8q776,,"**Hi,**

I completely share your perspective and mindset. As it stands, these approaches excel as coding productivity tools—but they are not a replacement for creating good software solutions.

We are currently rolling out Cursor for all developers (on a non-mandatory basis). The ones who find it a bit more challenging are .NET C# backend developers who are accustomed to Visual Studio.

Interestingly, we just hired a recent graduate specializing in Data Science and Cognition to support the AI team. From a “low-level” tech perspective, his experience is primarily in Python and C. I introduced him to Cursor, and naturally, he used Python Notebooks to experiment with potential solutions to the problems I assigned him. However, I told him, *“This is great, but we need a UI so that non-technical users can better understand how it behaves. Do you know React, HTML, or JavaScript to build a basic UI for demonstration?”* He didn’t.

So, I had another team member showcase how Cursor could help him quickly build a simple page with the assistance of the AI agent. Without prior knowledge of HTML, he created a small UI for his prototype in just a day.

This was impressive—but in no way was the result production-ready. However, it provided a tangible feel for the solution and its technical challenges. I think this is where some people might get carried away; the results look ""magical"" for todays standards, but…

Maybe I’m just getting old, but I remain skeptical of these new platforms that promote *no-code* as a pathway to successful software solutions. Beyond prototyping, I wouldn’t rely on these approaches for large-scale, production-grade applications—at least not yet. That said, one of the strengths of tools like Cursor is their ability to bridge the gap between rapid prototyping and fully developed, production-ready solutions.

Additionally, I see great potential in integrating these technologies with solid *low-code* platforms like OutSystems, particularly for building standard line-of-business (LoB) applications and integration solutions. I think this is an exciting area of development for such platforms.

**Cheers.**

Since then, I’ve encountered multiple issues. The most concerning ones include:

* It modified my `.xcodeproj` file, even though I never instructed it to do so, nor should it have been reading or modifying that file in the first place.
* It generated three copies of another file without any reason to do so.
* When I explicitly asked it to analyze an issue in a specific file, it not only analyzed it but also implemented various ""solutions"" on its own, which introduced multiple errors that I’m still trying to fix.
* Instead of analyzing the entire file as requested, it only considered a portion of it, then proceeded to modify the file based solely on that incomplete analysis. While this was easy to correct, it highlighted how easily it gets confused.

Overall, Sonnet 3.7 is generating files unnecessarily, duplicating existing files, modifying things it shouldn’t, and acting autonomously in ways that disrupt my workflow. Since encountering these issues, I’ve switched back to Sonnet 3.5, which remains the most stable version for me.

one thing that works well in large codebases (like vscode!) are to define project or cursor rules to help situate the agent in the codebase / provide context to the model. i would find it quite hard to be productive if dropped into a new codebase every day! alternatively providing manual pointers to files / code, though a bit tedious, does a great job of keeping it on track

I started using cursor a few weeks ago, and I really liked it. However, it wasn't until sonnet 3.7 dropped that it really blew my mind. This was a couple of weeks ago roughly. I remember asking for a complex test suite and providing a lot of context, writing a long prompt, and composer one-shot it. As I was reading the generated code, I couldn't believe it.

But, I was quickly disappointed after updating Cursor (I think it was to 0.46, not entirely sure). Suddenly it was reading files slower, in chunks, but even for smaller tasks it seemed to be way less effective - missing existing functions in the files provided as context, etc. This has been the case ever since the composer was removed.

As you can see, I had to start manually tagging my various `.mdc` files in each prompt to make sure they got picked up.

I've been thinking about what could be the problem, by the way. I have been running this repo since cursor 0.43.

1. Do you think the codebase index got corrupted somewhere between the major versions? Perhaps I could regenerate from scratch?
2. My other idea is that my backend repo is just too big to use with Cursor's latest summarisation logic. The whole thing is over 100k lines of code. In Cline, without using Repomix, 30-60 minutes of prompting results in a context window of 500k tokens. This may explain why things are constantly being pruned out of Agent's mind. I should say though that my functions are well split, a single file is always less than 250 LOC and test files are usually under 1k.
3. I looked through my PRs and since Cursor 0.45 I have only added 20k LOC, so Composer *was* crushing an 85k LOC project before 0.46. It really seems like something happened around the decommissioning of Chat/Composer moment.

Over the last week my usage of Agent has evolved to only working on single file refactors and very limited scope work. Kind of a like a juiced up Cmd+K. It seems to do OK on these but can no longer work from specification documents like it used to.

I would really like to get Cursor back to where it was before. I am literally happy to 5-10x my monthly bill if that's what it takes. Please let me know how I can help.

Ive been thinking about what could be the problem, by the way. I have been running this repo since cursor 0.43. 1. Do you think the codebase index got corrupted somewhere between the major versions? Perhaps I could regenerate from scratch? 2. My other idea is that my backend repo is just too big to use with Cursors latest summarisation logic. The whole thing is over 100k lines of code. In Cline, without using Repomix, 3060 minutes of prompting results in a context window of 500k tokens. This may explain why things are constantly being pruned out of Agents mind. I should say though that my functions are well split, a single file is always less than 250 LOC and test files are usually under 1k. 3. I looked through my PRs and since Cursor 0.45 I have only added 20k LOC, so Composer was crushing an 85k LOC project before 0.46.

mcqh1oa,,"As your codebase grows larger, it helps to change the way you guide the model. If you continue to interact with it as you did when working on simple tasks or tiny codebases, you may have disappointing results.

I find that for more complex codebases, it really helps to have an indexed requirements directory with files that you can reference when talking with the model. These can be higher-level specs that explain the different sections of the codebase, Mermaid diagrams that visualize flows/states/relationships, and requirements docs for specific aspects of the code. I continue to add these requirements docs when I find the model needs more guidance. For example, if the model is inconsistent with the way it implements a feature in different parts of the code, I'll ask it to create a requirements doc with rules for the feature. Then, any time it's updating code related to the feature, I'll reference the doc and ask that it ensures all updates comply with the doc's rules.

You should also build up rules for the model in ""Rules for AI"" (used on all Cursor projects) and ""Project Rules"" (used for a specific project and can be targeted to specific directories or files). I find the best way to write these rules is incrementally as you find the model getting confused or making mistakes.

Comments in the code can also help the model better understand how each file relates to the codebase as a whole.

Stop raging on OP like ""skill issue"".

I want to say: I feel you OP, been there a lot.

Indeed, most comments mention useful tactics / workarounds.

At the end of the day I think understanding the code matters the most.  
We're not yet at a stage where you can blindly trust the AI and let it do its thing.

What the fuck are you people even talking about right now. 3 months ago i could ask cursor to copy the code of X component and then do Z component based on that. it would work fine, furthermore, i could then do changes to Z component and tell it to based on that fix some other thing, it had no problem.

now it struggles to imitate X on Z and when i do changes to Z and tell it to based on those changes add something else, it goes back to its own version of Z disregarding the changes i just made.

this is clear degradation in the quality of the responses. it's not some ""projects grow"" bullshit because it happens with all projects, like I said, it happens on new and small projects as well as in big and complex projects.

you can twist it around as much as you like, the only truth is that cursor right now is much worse than it was 3 months ago.

the reason why the quality of the responses went down, is that the team at cursor constantly push updates that mess with the composer degrading the quality of the responses, i don't know if they do it unconciously or if they do it to cut costs, but it's obvious that the quality of the responses went down, i've been using cursor for 6+ months, it's not hard to notice that the quality is going down, specially because every week we get new quirks and shit we have to play around.

2 weeks ago it was slow responses taking 5+ minutes, now it's cursor being incapable of adapting to code changes which is maddening tbh. how is it possible that it ignores changes you do to your code?

to give you a clear example, i have a button, classname=""p-3 m-2"" i tell cursor to increase the margin, it outputs classname=""p-3 m-4"", fine, then i decide 4 was too much so i lower it to 3. i then ask it to do something else and it corrects the margin back to 4 even though i just gave it the new code that had the m-3. this was not an issue a few weeks ago, now it happens all the time. even if i literally tell it that i adapted their code and that it shoudl reanalize it, it still disregards what i'm passing to it and pulls code from before.

so essentially it's refusing to read new code thinking that it is the same, this is basic LLM lazyness and it happens when you reduce the amount of tokens.

mf4pqpq,,"The annoying part with AI is that there’s not really a clear-cut point where things start going wrong.

That said, I usually find that the second you start working on a problem that doesn’t have a commonly known solution, even if you describe your solution in detail to the point that any intern could pick up the task, there’s a pretty decent chance you’ll get a bad response.

In particular, when a codebase gets large enough (spread across multiple entry point apps and libs), I’ve found cursor starts to hallucinate dependencies, types, enum members, etc. Yes, even when I include the specific files to be used as dependencies. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great at what it does, but a single hallucinated dependency can easily ruin an entire set of output and clarifying further usually does not help.

I find it especially bad for making small specific changes, as just manually coding the solution with the help of cursor tab is WAY faster than writing up a plain-English description.

I’ve personally found my best workflow to be:
- Use composer for new files that need boilerplate while providing copious examples of similar files
- Use agent mode for writing tests
- Use chat mode like a rubber duck that knows how to code

Building an optimized web app isn’t that hard with cursor. You just gotta look at the complexity of that app. There is stuff that will be hard for someone clueless in cursor when it gets too complicated but some basic stuff using APIs and existing libraries? No problem.

But at the end I also have the feeling, the knowledge that you say someone “needs” can kinda be replaced with more grind in many instances. Also those arguments always read like they expect the non developer to be entirely stupid… you can still find out correct approaches to achieve your goals without knowing them at the beginning of the project.. just be honest with yourself and research the things you don’t know… with AI that’s as easy as never before…

The knowledgeable web dev will be way quicker achieving his stuff in cursor because he won’t do all kinds of stupid prompts.

But I would disagree in the notion that it’s impossible to also achieve it without actually being a dev… Just gotta box you out of the endless loops of errors when you don’t understand the issues (or just try again with a different prompt (or just ask for potential solutions and then go over to fix stuff)

What is the superior code worth with a trashy concept?

mftxfxs,,"Thing is 1 you don’t know what you don’t know. There is a prompting advantage to those who know stuff. Even if it’s just what questions to ask. And if you start with little knowledge and learn what to ask over time you are actually learning programming. Maybe not the syntax of programming, but like the guy who wrote all the programming books Tim oreilly wrote in his blog recently, we’ve just hit a place where the next higher level programming language has become English. I’ve been at this long enough (ai coding) to confidently say nothing just magically appeared without a lot of thoughtful prompting and the English is basically the same as the logic of normal programming without needing to bother with the syntax of a language. 

As a developer it’s actually pretty freeing to vibe code in languages I don’t even understand myself for the most part. The field of programming is large enough that even if you are an expert in one area of it you can’t be in all areas of it. The fundamentals help you leap to other areas and draw parallels like do this thing I would have done in the language I know but in the language I don’t.

2. I know stuff and I’m still spending all my time prompting. Things get done much faster but the stuff I’m attempting to build alone now would have taken a team of 4 before over a period of months. I don’t doubt that the number of developers needed will decrease to create the same output over time, but as has always been in the case in the past the market just demands more. And maybe some day AI will be able to do the whole thing without developers, but right now I’m just trying to make more alone and that has me working all the time. Not sure how long it’s going to be before you don’t actually need any developers any more, but right now it still takes a lot of time with AI to build a full product and someone needs to do it as a job. And from a practical perspective there are real productivity advantages to someone trained in development using these tools over someone who isn’t and can only 100% vibe code. 

What is left to be seen though is what happens when you pit the 100% vibe coders against the developer luddites who refuse to use these new tools, of which there are many. I did a poll a little while back and it was something like 1/3+ developers refused to use ai tools because they were adamant they suck and they preferred the control of doing it all themselves. I think we might see the vibe coders beating experienced Luddite developers with experience at some point as the AI will just be so much faster than manual typing.

I wouldn’t poo poo the power of experienced developers who have also gone all in on these tools though. You don’t know what you don’t know and knowing stuff allows you to connect knowledge to capability instantly with ai. Can’t tell you the number of times I’m watching the agent code and I’m like “why are you doing this?

Which is sort of the other pole of this conversation, the people criticizing the output quality of LLMs. If you can read the code and understand the logic it’s not hard to notice when it leaves a clean pattern and to tell it to fix it and write a rule stopping it from doing it again.

The scope is largely to achieve the baseline quality that even a very mediocre engineer will bring to the table.

When I look at all kinds of low/no code platforms to build websites and stuff like that for non devs, they are essentially already replaceable.

With AI non devs can suddenly create software. And while the framing here sounds like they would be inferior to the devs I disagree hard.

AI enables all kinds of people from different professional backgrounds to create software and make the ability to code secondary. Those people  surely are worse at coding, but they are way better than most devs at their very own topic.

Medical influenced people could build software concepts from scratch in their field that no dev would ever think of without the needed insight and that no company would ever build due to limited income potential.

It puts the app/software concept at the forefront imo.

mfu83i7,,"Yeah I think where we are disagreeing is you don’t think what you are doing is development because you aren’t writing a programming language to make your software. 

Given I don’t know what you are building I can assume though that you are giving instructions in English that when translated into code by AI are actually closer to code than you might realize. English has become the new higher level programming language. This is conceptually similar to when higher level languages like JavaScript or Python were created to simplify programming and got compiled down into assembly or c++. 

I’m sure there were people at the time who thought coding like that wasn’t real coding because real coding was writing straight assembly. But almost all coding became using higher level languages because it saved so much time.

Development at its core is the progress of starting with some requirements and working with the computer until it can do those requirements. That’s still what you are doing and still takes considerable time even with ai. It’s still a job and not every non developer would want to sit in front of the computer wrestling with the AI for hours until the goal was achieved.

1j1kemq,"Cursor is a Game-Changer, But You Still Need the Basics","I’ve been in software engineering for over 20 years and hold a PhD in ML. I love Cursor—it’s an incredible tool that can 10x productivity, especially when working within a known language or framework.

For my daily work, I primarily use Python, and most of the time, I know 90% of what needs to be done (the rest I look up along the way). In these cases, Cursor is amazing. It speeds up development, helps with boilerplate code, and fills in gaps efficiently.

However, I’ve also tested Cursor on technologies I wasn’t familiar with. I built a web app in Next.js despite having only worked with Angular before. While I eventually completed the project, it took a lot of iterations and requests. Then, I tried building an iOS app with SwiftUI. This time, I burned through countless requests, got stuck, and ultimately couldn’t finish it. At some point, it felt like I might succeed, but I realized I was just patching things together without fully understanding how they worked.

This experience taught me a key lesson: AI can help tremendously, but it’s not a shortcut to deep understanding. Trying to build a production-ready app without grasping the framework’s core concepts leads to frustration and wasted time. Now, I’ve decided to properly learn SwiftUI before attempting another project.

My advice? Before diving into a new stack, take time to understand its fundamentals—basic building blocks, core patterns, and underlying concepts.

* I’m working on an AI product, so my focus is on optimizing prompts, tracking my to-do list, and documenting everything that can be useful for developers.

Saves us a ton of time on boilerplate code and enforces best engineering practices on code we craft ourselves. Just be wary that at times it goes off the rails and so you still need to guide it accordingly.

mci4gu0,,"I have one for you, my man.

I’m non-technical, and this is how I use Cursor:

* **ChatGPT** – I use it for all documentation, prompting, and general product advice. With a clear project description, I actually prefer GPT-4o over all other advanced modules because it’s straightforward and gives me exactly what I need.
* **Notion** – I use it for *all* documentation. I keep everything related to the project—concept overview, customer pain points, tech stack, etc.—on a single page. You *can* organize it under toggle headers for better visuals, but it doesn’t really matter. The *main* reason I use Notion is that ChatGPT can access it. That’s why I keep everything on one big page rather than spreading it across multiple pages—it ensures ChatGPT always has a complete, holistic view of the app.
* **Cursor** – I use it for actual development. Since I usually define the development scope with ChatGPT first, mistakes are minimal. Also, I *almost never* use more than one message in a single Composer session. I have ChatGPT define the prompt so well (including code examples, environment variables, etc.) that it becomes a piece of cake for Composer to execute. I’d say I spend around 60% of my time in ChatGPT defining what needs to be built and learning new things (auth, APIs, whatever), 25% updating Notion (since it has to stay up to date), and only 15% in Cursor actually coding.

I know my approach is kind of like wearing two condoms—super safe. But I’ve tried *raw* prompting in Replit, v0, and even Composer, and all I got were constant headaches and bugs I couldn’t fix as a non-developer.

So, the *MCP* I’d love to have? A constant connection to a knowledge base like Notion. If I could set a project rule that forces Composer to *always* check the documentation before starting *any* development and cross-reference it with the codebase and our goals, I think it would reduce mistakes by 90%.",2025-02-12 21:10:07,1,0,0.0,cursor,anaem1c,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1inw2lt/cursor_interacting_with_chrome_dev_tools/mci4gu0/,"I have one for you, my man.

[https://x.com/kregenrek/status/1892884736059613652](https://x.com/kregenrek/status/1892884736059613652)

**UI Update:**

Cursor 0.46 is here and we got some fresh UI Updates.  
  
Chat -> Ask  
Composer (normal) -> Edit  
Composer (agent) -> Agent  
  
You can switch between modes with ⌘+.

**Git Reference:**

Cursor 0.46 explains you what happened in a specific Git Commit.

https://reddit.com/link/1iuvain/video/lbfq3ajasike1/player

**No window switch anymore**

You can now switch between modes within the same context.  
  
For example, you can ask something and then start the agent based on that or vice versa. This eliminates the need to transfer context between windows.

TBH this is still confusing. I liked the old version better where don't had two buttons with the same highlighting style. It's like having a ""Ok"" and ""Confirm"" button. It also seems to be a bit buggy. If you apply and reapply files a few times, you don't get any changes.

The AIs are good at writing .md files, so give that a go. And figure out ask mode instead of code mode. It saves copypasting at least.","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': 0.9778}",0.9778,"{'polarity': 0.04732289107289105, 'subjectivity': 0.5735462735462736}",0.04732289107289105,0.5735462735462736,Positive,0.9778

Perhaps because you're so familiar with technical details, you don't feel the need for AI assistance. Everyone is at different levels and stages, so their requirements for AI will vary accordingly.

For me, AI programming, especially Cursor, is incredibly useful! It brings back that initial feeling of learning to program - that sensation of solving problems with simple thinking. Programming should serve to complete tasks, and if there's a simple way to achieve it, it shouldn't be complicated. When I first learned VB or C, I felt programming was truly enjoyable. Simple tasks could be completed easily, and even complex tasks felt manageable by combining a series of simple methods.

But what has programming become in recent years? New frameworks appear almost every month, each with its own set of complex rules. Now, even implementing the simplest task has become very complicated. For example, adding a browser control to a window - in VB, you could just drag and drop the control, and a few lines of code would complete many tasks. After switching to the .NET platform, this same task became extremely complex. I've done this type of design several times, but I still can't remember how to do it and need to refer to my notes.

Now AI handles all these complex details for you, eliminating the complexity of these frameworks. It allows people to have an easier time. However, AI applications might gradually become more complex themselves - this seems to be a general rule of how things work, and might be unavoidable.

1j7rdoa,I use Cursor daily - here's how I avoid the garbage parts,"AI for coding is in a weird spot right now.

You get people claiming that you can build a complete SaaS in 3 days, and others saying that it's worse than useless. Both of these people are probably just exaggerating or straight up lying.

I love coding with Cursor, it's completely changed the way I code, but it's also complete garbage a good deal of the time.

So as an AI skeptic I'll tell you everything I know to make your experience as good as possible.

If you prefer watching rather than reading, here’s a [YT video with the same content.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC2b7wMfalI)

## CursorRules

Let's start with an easy one. 

If you don't have a .cursorrules file you are missing out.

You can have one ready to go in about 10 minutes, and it will save you hours of time.

Look up your stack on this [list of cursorrules](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules?tab=readme-ov-file#contents) and pull out the best bits.

But my advice is to keep it reasonably minimal and then build on it over time.

You don't need this massive file with every single programming best practice outlined.

The reason for shitty AI output is not because it forgot about DRY or SOLID. And I find that giving it too much input, and having longer chats, is when it starts to fall apart a bit. So keep it light. And here's the thing: if you notice the same issues popping up again and again, just add a quick line telling it not to. Or even better, in your cursor chat just say please write me a cursorrule so that you stop doing this particular thing. And then chuck it in there.

Like mine will keep forgetting about nullish coallescing (??) in JS, and even after I fix it up it will revert my change in its future changes. So of course I put that rule in and it won't happen again.

And then at the top of the file, just write some text about what the project is about. If you have a particular file structure and way of organising code that is great to put in as well.

## Getting the best output

I have found *by far* the best thing for improving the output is telling it exactly where to find the code it might otherwise spit out at you. 

Like if you know it's going to need a certain function, or create a procedure very similar to something that exists, give it that context. And you don't necessarily need to tell it the exact function - we're trying to make our lives easier here, of course I still want this to be easier than just writing the code myself. 

After I tell it what I want I often just do a `see @schedule.ts @utils.ts @ScheduleHeader.tsx` and just include anything that will help it do its task - even in a more abstract ""here's how something vaguely similar has been done"" kind of way. 

The AI has been trained on a bunch of random code, so if there's anything particular to your project, then you need to tell it.

## Random tips

Okay and let's get into some rapid fire tips.

- I like Composer (Agent) for simple, low impact changes. And Chat (Ask) for everything else. Just the step of manually having to click apply and taking that extra second to think about the changes it's making, and in which files it's happening, rather than just be presented with a wave of green changes ready to get smashed in.
- Don't blindly accept code. It's always gonna come back to bite you.
- Every so often make sure you read and fully understand the most integral parts of your code, and refactor it *manually.* You will find a lot of gaps, and fixing it up means future AI-written code will be better.
- Ask ""is this the best way to do this?"" or ""have you considered xyz"".
- Learn when a problem is best solved manually.
- Take extra care when using AI to fix bugs. I think it's particularly weak at fixing anything but the silliest of bugs. And it can cause a lot of damage in the process.
- If it's a big and important task or you are setting the foundations for a feature, ask it to ask you any questions before writing code to make sure it has a full understanding of what you are trying to do.

One of the best things about AI is that you can now write code when your brain is fried, and tackling a problem would normally be outside of your reach.

It's great for sitting on the couch and cranking out some mostly decent code, but then other days of course you just spend an hour chasing ""You're right"" ""I see the issue now"" only to end up in a worse place than you started.

But I would recommend experimenting with it and learning how best to talk to it. It's not going away, and it's just another tool that you can use.

And if you're a junior developer I would of course be very wary with it. And anyone for that matter really. I do think there's something to be said for the atrophying of my coding skills.

- Don't blindly accept code. It's always gonna come back to bite you.
- Every so often make sure you read and fully understand the most integral parts of your code, and refactor it *manually.* You will find a lot of gaps, and fixing it up means future AI-written code will be better.
- Ask ""is this the best way to do this?"" or ""have you considered xyz"".
- Learn when a problem is best solved manually.
- Take extra care when using AI to fix bugs. I think it's particularly weak at fixing anything but the silliest of bugs. And it can cause a lot of damage in the process.
- If it's a big and important task or you are setting the foundations for a feature, ask it to ask you any questions before writing code to make sure it has a full understanding of what you are trying to do.

One of the best things about AI is that you can now write code when your brain is fried, and tackling a problem would normally be outside of your reach.

It's great for sitting on the couch and cranking out some mostly decent code, but then other days of course you just spend an hour chasing ""You're right"" ""I see the issue now"" only to end up in a worse place than you started.

But I would recommend experimenting with it and learning how best to talk to it. It's not going away, and it's just another tool that you can use.

And if you're a junior developer I would of course be very wary with it. And anyone for that matter really. I do think there's something to be said for the atrophying of my coding skills.

Thanks for reading :) Hope it was valuable","I use Cursor daily heres how I avoid the garbage parts AI for coding is in a weird spot right now. You get people claiming that you can build a complete SaaS in 3 days, and others saying that its worse than useless. Both of these people are probably just exaggerating or straight up lying. I love coding with Cursor, its completely changed the way I code, but its also complete garbage a good deal of the time. So as an AI skeptic Ill tell you everything I know to make your experience as good as possible. If you prefer watching rather than reading, heres a YT video with the same content. CursorRules Lets start with an easy one. If you dont have a .cursorrules file you are missing out. You can have one ready to go in about 10 minutes, and it will save you hours of time. Look up your stack on this list of cursorrules and pull out the best bits. But my advice is to keep it reasonably minimal and then build on it over time. You dont need this massive file with every single programming best practice outlined. The reason for shitty AI output is not because it forgot about DRY or SOLID. And I find that giving it too much input, and having longer chats, is when it starts to fall apart a bit. So keep it light. And heres the thing if you notice the same issues popping up again and again, just add a quick line telling it not to. Or even better, in your cursor chat just say please write me a cursorrule so that you stop doing this particular thing. And then chuck it in there. Like mine will keep forgetting about nullish coallescing ?? in JS, and even after I fix it up it will revert my change in its future changes. So of course I put that rule in and it wont happen again. And then at the top of the file, just write some text about what the project is about. If you have a particular file structure and way of organising code that is great to put in as well. Getting the best output I have found by far the best thing for improving the output is telling it exactly where to find the code it might otherwise spit out at you. Like if you know its going to need a certain function, or create a procedure very similar to something that exists, give it that context. And you dont necessarily need to tell it the exact function were trying to make our lives easier here, of course I still want this to be easier than just writing the code myself. After I tell it what I want I often just do a see .ts .ts .tsx and just include anything that will help it do its task even in a more abstract heres how something vaguely similar has been done kind of way. The AI has been trained on a bunch of random code, so if theres anything particular to your project, then you need to tell it. Random tips Okay and lets get into some rapid fire tips.

I've seen some discussions where people ask if **CursorAI** is a good tool for beginners or even non-programmers, and I think it's important to clarify what it actually does and who it’s for.

At its core, **CursorAI is an AI-powered IDE** built to **enhance a programmer's workflow**, not replace programming knowledge. It’s designed for people who already understand **how to code** and want to speed up development, reduce boilerplate, and get AI-powered assistance in their coding environment. Here's why non-programmers will likely struggle with it:

# 1. You Still Need to Understand Code

CursorAI is **not a no-code or low-code tool**. It doesn't magically build applications for you. It assists **by suggesting code completions, refactoring existing code, debugging, and answering technical questions**—but if you don’t already know how to write and read code, these suggestions won’t make sense.

For example, if you ask Cursor to ""generate a React component,"" it will spit out React code, but **you still need to understand what that code does, how to modify it, and how to integrate it into a larger project**. If you have zero programming knowledge, you'll be stuck wondering what to do with the output.

# 2. AI Assistance ≠ Learning to Code

While CursorAI can help clarify concepts and answer programming questions, it **doesn't replace learning how to program**. A beginner would still be better off learning programming fundamentals through structured resources like freeCodeCamp, CS50, or other beginner courses.

A tool like ChatGPT or DeepSeek might help explain concepts, but **without a foundation in programming, you won’t be able to verify if AI-generated code is correct, efficient, or secure.** AI can hallucinate, make mistakes, and produce inefficient solutions—things that require real programming experience to catch.

# 3. Debugging Requires Knowledge, Not Just AI Assistance

One of CursorAI’s best features is **inline debugging** and error-fixing suggestions. But if you don’t understand programming, **you won’t know why a bug exists, why the AI’s suggestion works (or doesn’t), or what deeper issues might be lurking.**

AI-generated fixes are great, but **blindly applying them without understanding** is a recipe for disaster, especially for complex systems. If a beginner pastes AI-generated code into a project without understanding it, they could introduce bugs that they can’t debug themselves.

# 4. It’s an AI-Powered Productivity Booster for Devs

The main **value proposition of CursorAI** is improving developer productivity. It helps devs **write code faster, debug more efficiently, and generate code snippets for common tasks.**

But it’s not a magic “make an app” button—it won’t teach you:

* How to structure a project
* How different programming languages work
* How to think like a programmer
* How to make architectural decisions

# 5. Non-Programmers Will Be Lost Without Context

A complete beginner using CursorAI would **have no frame of reference** for its suggestions. Even if it generates a full function, **what then?** What file should it go in? How do you test it? What dependencies does it require? Without prior programming experience, these are huge blockers.",2025-02-12 01:14:21,89,71,0.87,cursor,chunkypenguion1991,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1inn0oy/use_cursor_for_what_its_meant_for/,"Use cursor for what its meant for Cursor was never designed not intended for people with zero coding knowledge to write apps

Well, with the new Agent mode, it will put it in the right file, it will generate tests for it, it will even run the tests if you tell it to. And it can use the CLI to install any needed dependencies.

Having said that, if the project is too complex, there WILL be a point where something happens that neither the non-coder nor the LLMs will be able to fix. At that point, programming knowledge will be needed, and usually more than what you can get from a quick bootcamp.

1j56j7i,Found a workaround for Cursor context limit,"I found a really good workaround for this problem everyone has been having, but it takes about an hour of setup.

1. Set up a Google Gemini API key (free)
2. Set up `cursor-tools` (you can find this on GitHub)
3. Follow the installation steps and integrate it into your project (the cursorrules file is important)
4. Every time you give big instructions, at the bottom of the prompt tell Agent to ""ask Gemini to help you plan, and when you are finished, ask it to review your work""
5. `cursor-tools` zips the *entire* repo, uploads it to Gemini (which has a 2 million context token window), and it comes back with very clever analysis and a smart feedback loop for Agent. They kind of start talking to each other which is really cool to watch.

This workflow is generating really good results. I guess a lot of the intelligence problems really are down to the context summarisation.

The other thing I found works well is to ignore the new ""Start a new chat for better results"" message. Starting a new chat seems to lower the IQ of Cursor a lot, so I am sticking to the same chat for a day or two until a feature/project is completed.

Edit: I would recommend only attempting this if you are an experienced developer, because I've had to solve numerous configuration issues over the last 24 hours to get to 100% perfection, and even now it could break at any moment. But it is pretty incredible. My Cursor (v0.46.10) is one shotting very complex tasks again with Claude 3.7 Thinking + Gemini Pro.

Notes:

- 0.5.0, the version you can just npm install right now, only seems to work up to 1 million tokens
- 0.6.0-alpha.7 supports OpenRouter and [you can force it to use the 2 million token model](https://github.com/eastlondoner/cursor-tools/issues/57)
- But the alpha version randomly crashes about 1 in 10 times. You will waste fast requests restoring checkpoint and restarting it, if you care about that.
- Auto setup seems to automatically create the .cursorrules file but it doesn't work all the time, you should create the [.mdc](https://github.com/eastlondoner/cursor-tools/blob/2fbb1dfd5760c4712b98489bd133095225432827/.cursor/rules/cursor-tools.mdc) file instead.
- If you have a complex shell setup with zsh, zshell, nvm etc, cursor-tools might not be available inside the Agent's shell. You will have to debug this yourself.

1. This is a lot to keep track of, I'm lost, 'I'm not sure where I am' 
   1. This can be because you had to go off on a tangent to fix a little bug, or, because the task you're trying to do is so big, you've just lost track.
2. I wish I'd documented what I asked for, so I can learn next time how to do this better
3. It's lost, it's forgotten all the little details I told it and now  it's guessing

We have a solution, and it's simple.

In Agent Mode, type out what you want it to do, or better still, type it in a text editor and copy and paste in, you can use new lines simpler.

You will be wildly impressed to see the [todolist.md](http://todolist.md) file created with tick boxes.

Check in the [Todo.md](http://Todo.md) file to git.

Last step...

>""implement that tasks in [TODO.md](http://TODO.md), be sure to tick them off as you complete them.""

And off it goes.

Is it 100% bulletproof perfect? no, it still made some mistakes. But it really helps you keep track of progress, and fix things faster too.

Also, it did just keep going, and going, and going, FANTASTIC.

On top of that, I also use multiple cursor rules and set up projectspecific rules to streamline it. That said, even with all this setup, when the cursor starts acting dumb, its just dumb. Theres no fixing it. But when it work well? Then yes, this is the absolute best and most efficient setup.","{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.168, 'compound': 0.9587}",0.9587,"{'polarity': 0.10882352941176471, 'subjectivity': 0.29934640522875816}",0.10882352941176471,0.29934640522875816,Positive,0.9587

Not exactly something I could ever sell, due to being such a specific use case. But instead of getting some pricy SaaS that would only fit about 75% of our needs, I built the perfect one.

1iojub2,How I solved Cursor's hallucination problems with Supabase using 2 MCP Protocols,"Hey r/cursor!

I wanted to share some interesting findings from my recent experiments with Cursor AI and Supabase integration. Like many of you, I've been frustrated with Cursor occasionally hallucinating when generating React components, especially when dealing with complex database schemas.

I've been working on a solution using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that has dramatically improved the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated code. The key breakthrough came from creating a dedicated MCP server that acts as a ""truth source"" for Supabase schema information.

What's different about this approach:

* Instead of relying on Cursor to interpret database structures from code snippets, the MCP server provides real-time, accurate schema information
* The server understands complex relationships, RLS policies, and type constraints, preventing common AI hallucinations
* Generated React components are always in sync with the actual database structure
* No more back-and-forth fixing incorrect type assumptions or mismatched field names

Some unexpected benefits I discovered:

* The AI generates much more precise TypeScript types since it has direct access to the schema
* RLS policies are automatically considered when generating data fetching logic
* Foreign key relationships are properly maintained in forms and data displays
* Schema changes are immediately reflected without needing to update context files

I've also developed a dynamic context system using gemini-2.0-pro-exp that automatically updates as your codebase context and instructions as it evolves, which has been a game-changer for larger projects. The AI seems to understand the codebase much better than with static  @ Codebase references.

Questions for the community:

* Has anyone else experimented with MCP for improving AI accuracy?
* What are your biggest pain points with Cursor generating database-connected components?
* Would you be interested in seeing this released as an open-source tool?

I'm particularly curious about your experiences with Cursor hallucinations in database-heavy applications and how you've addressed them.

1j2rgj2,🚀 Just Released: Cursor Rules CLI - Auto-scan your project & install relevant Cursor rules in one command,"Disclaimer: This is a community-driven project not officially associated with Cursor.I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions! Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey r/cursor community!

I'm excited to share a tool I've been working on that makes finding and installing Cursor rules super easy: Cursor Rules CLI.

https://i.redd.it/sk0xovit2jme1.gif

What it does:

* 🔍 Automatically scans your project to detect libraries and frameworks
* 📥 Installs the most relevant Cursor rules directly to your rules folder
* 🎨 Beautiful, intuitive CLI interface
* 🔒 100% privacy-focused (all scanning happens locally)

How it works: Just run cursor-rules in your project directory, and it does all the work for you - no more manual searching or guessing which rules you need!

    pip install cursor-rules
    # Scan your project and install matching rules
    cursor-rules

What makes it special: The rules are created using a  two-step process:

1. Semantic search with Exa to gather best practices
2. LLM enhancement to create structured, optimized content

1ipqiyg,Maximizing Cursor AI – What’s Your Best Workflow Hack?,"I’ve been using the Cursor pro plan for close to **4 months now**. I’m constantly trying out new ways to optimize my workflow to write code easier/faster.

**These have worked for me:**

* Optimizing `.cursorrules` by having the agent ""self-improve"" the rules after a coding session.
* Using debug statements liberally to help the agent find issues
* I ask it to start every reply with a random animal emoji 🦊. If I no longer see the emoji then I know it’s lost context

**Wins:**

* The self-improvement does seem to help to a point
* I am pretty hard core about starting new sessions an that helps a lot
* Debug statements do help it fix issues. Without them it tends to spin out.

**Losses:**

* Agent mode spins out when working on less popular tech (not js or react).

If your project structure is lengthy, you can omit apprelated files and retain only the most important ones. Additionally, I include .env file titles to prevent the agent from assuming incorrect or different titles. This helps maintain consistency and clarity throughout the project.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.193, 'compound': 0.9606}",0.9606,"{'polarity': 0.06694214876033057, 'subjectivity': 0.5526859504132231}",0.06694214876033057,0.5526859504132231,Positive,0.9606

mdnz9m9,,"I'm using Nuxt for two projects and this has been my workflow.

In ChatGPT Plus (webGUI), I have had a long chat, brainstorm session, detailing as much as possible: project summary, goals, milestones, features, etc. After I had all I _thought I needed_, I told ChatGPT to ask me 10 questions about the project to help it further understand. 

This took me about two days, answering in depth all I could about these projects. One is a ecommerce with NuxtUI, SquareAPI & Supabase. Other is for an automotive enthusiast community using Shadcn & Supabase. Both with Supabase buckets for storage, auth, members, uploads, etc.

I had ChatGPT + Canvas create a `readme-brainstorm.md` from all the information we generated. From there several others were created `readme-milestone-planning.md` and `readme-next-days-agenda.md`.

In Cursor, after init new project, install all dependencies, I told it to read the above readme docs and break it down into more manageable files. 

`readme-milestone-planning.md` has all the project goals, tasks, sub-tasks, version numbers for releases/deployments. We update this frequently throughout the day. Some of the larger tasks got their own docs file.

`readme-next-days-agenda.md` has 3 main headings: Current Project Status, Completed Today, and Next Steps. We refer to this at the start and end of my 'Daily Sprints'.

The second project has grown far more complex than initially anticipated. And we often times end up creating new `readme-*.md` docs. At this point I now have over a dozen markdown docs files: schema, seo, terms, testing-strategy, various features.

Also, I started with a basic `.cursorrules` file and tell Cursor to update as needed.

Example: sometimes it wants to install something we don't need or is already installed, or sometimes vee-validate would conflict with shadcn, or it would forget to use `<NuxtImg>` instead of `<img>`.

Recently we struggled to get proper form sumission handler typing correct. After we got the right syntax, I asked Composer ""what did we learn today?"", and it would outline what it did wrong and what the solution was. So I would tell it to add that solution to `.cursorrules`.

My cursorrules file is over 400 lines long. I got curious around 300 lines, thinking it was too big/complex. I've seen others use markdown for their rules, but mine is json formatted. I duplicated the cursorrules (.cursorrules-01 & .cursorrules-020, one in markdown, the other json structured. In Composer I told it to read both files and asked it which it preferred?! It actually chose the json structure. It said it preferred that method, so I told it to rewrite it to be more efficient, and it ended up restructuring the whole thing along with varying priorities, references to my other doc files, it listed all the Nuxt modules in use.

1j21lo8,Cursor vs Claude Code,"I've tried Claude Code over the last few days on a few Ruby on Rails 7 and 8 codebases that I work on.   
  
It's interesting, and it has a few features that would be good additions to Cursor.   
  
Compared to cursor:

The good:

* Very high code quality. This thing blows Cursor out of the water. I can't believe both use the same model when I see the difference in how Claude-3.7 behaves in Cursor and how it behaves in Claude Code. It's a completely different experience, on the same codebase with the same model. 
* It reports if its context is nearly filled, and allows you to compact it (summarise) or clear it. Great feature that Cursor should have too. 
* No 'can't connect to Anthropic' or 'can't connect to OpenAI' errors.
* Less errors compared to Cursor operating on the same codebase after writing code.
* I've had no functionality breaking mistakes, which do happen every now and then with Cursor, where it just breaks something or large files are truncated. 

The bad:

* It's not an IDE, but a node based terminal application that works on your codebase. That makes it a bit harder to work with (it would be fun to run it on an old VT200 terminal by the way). 
* The price! Working on just a few new features in a Rails app for around 3 hours kost me around $20,- in Claude Code. That's not cheap compared to what I pay for Cursor in a month and definitely something Claude should fix. 
* No MCP servers in Claude Code (at least I haven't been able to figure out how), though I haven't really missed them. Since it's a terminal app, Claude Code can execute all sorts of commands.   
* Cursor on the other hand is much cheaper, but that might also be its downfall. I'm perfectly willing to to pay more for Cursor if the quality it delivers is higher and more consistent.

1iqmbv7,Let Cursor & Windsurf interact with your Supabase autonomously,"So... this weekend I've had some time on my hands and decided to finally explore how to build and work with MCP servers.

Well... it turns out if you connect Supabase to Cursor / Windsurf via MCP server you essentially get an AI database agent that can not only write SQL queries (baby stuff), but actually:

* execute them
* debug them
* iterate on them

It's now possible to just ask it ""Count the number of messages my users sent"" and it will iterate until completion. 🤯 Check out how it works in the demo video.

\---

**How to set it up:**

* Clone the repo
* Install dependencies
* Add MCP server to Cursor & Windsurf
* Enjoy! 🙌

There are more detailed instructions in the README file of the repo itself.

mcd5wig,,"First of all, Cursor is not ""AI"", it's a program that uses AI to do many things. So you can criticize cursor's integration of AI, and also the AI separately.

Many of the LLMs in Cursor are, indeed, very poorly optimized for many purposes. That's why you have to learn what things they're good at, and which aren't. You already stated you use it, so you should know a few of these things.

For example, if you're having a complex bug in a piece of code, just giving it to sonnet or gpt-4o is most likely not going to give you a solution. LLMs are trained from autocomplete models, so they're likely to follow a pattern.

- Sonnet, for example, is trained to always think it knows what the problem is, so it will confidently propose changes that do nothing, or even worse, break the program more than it already was broken.
- gpt-4o has a good general picture of things, sometimes better than sonnet, especially for strategy, but it's much poorer regarding implementation and troubleshooting.
- deepseek r1 has a very good thinking process, which you can copypaste into sonnet to get much better troubleshooting from the thinking and observation of the more ""thoughtful"" model (r1), and then hand it to the more optimized ""implementation"" model (sonnet)
- o1 is very good at both thinking and implementation, though not necessarily better in all things than sonnet, but it can definitely read code better and find hidden issues more easily.
- o1 pro, when used from the ChatGPT Pro interface, is much better than the normal o1, due to the unlimited allotted thinking time, which is very short compared to r1 for example

So in the end, pick the right tools. Picking the right tools is considered a skill. So skill issue, git gud.

To provide its features, Cursor makes AI requests to our server. This happens for many different reasons. For example, we send AI requests when you ask questions in chat, we send AI requests on every keystroke so that Cursor Tab can make suggestions for you, and we may also send AI requests in the background for building up context or looking for bugs to show you.

An AI request generally includes context such as your recently viewed files, your conversation history, and relevant pieces of code based on language server information. This code data is sent to our infrastructure on AWS, and then to the appropriate language model inference provider (Fireworks/OpenAI/Anthropic/Google). Note that the requests always hit our infrastructure on AWS even if you have configured your own API key for OpenAI in the settings.

We currently do not have the ability to direct-route from the Cursor app to your enterprise deployment of OpenAI/Azure/Anthropic, as our prompt-building happens on our server, and our custom models on Fireworks are critical in providing a good user experience. We do not yet have a self-hosted server deployment option

When I was an undergrad in physics, my assignments were difficult to the extent that nobody could realistically do it alone (except for the freaky geniuses that were a shoe in for academia). My group would poke around independently on the problem set, try to synthesize information, and then we’d get together  and debrief what we figured out. Many times we’d have “experts” for certain problems, and the point was to complete the assignment and understand all parts of all problems.

The only people who were ultimately burned come midterms/finals were the ones mindlessly copying and not really trying to understand.


So if you’re using cursor, amazing!

1j8s1w7,You’re using Cursor rules the wrong way,"I spent too much time fixing AI-generated code. After testing different approaches, I found a way to build rules that actually works.

Here’s what made the biggest difference:

1. Force Cursor in .cursorrules file to follow your .mdc project rules

2. Keep rules simple and focused. Don’t dump everything into one big file

3. Create a new rule whenever AI repeats a mistake

4. Let AI write rules for you. Use meta-rules to automate this

5. Enable visibility rules to see what’s applied in every AI action

To make understanding easier, I built an interactive course where you can try these approaches in Cursor IDE with real examples. Check it out, it’s free: [https://enlightby.ai/#/projects/35](https://enlightby.ai/#/projects/35)

You can also find extension on Visual Studio marketplace: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ai-dl.enlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ai-dl.enlighter)

1j6qm58,Cursor DESTROYED MailChimp in 304 words,"Have you ever wanted to send email 'alerts' to your customers?

You probably thought of Mailchimp, or if you're into open source Mautic. Both great options, but I have serious number of different lists to create and aspirations for more.

This is how Cursor wrote a complete, working, fully functional, I mean confirmation double opt in, the alert email template, subscriber list, preference page, subscribe box, the whole lot in ... THREE HUNDRED WORDS of prompting!

Let's back up a bit, a little context

I created [https://pricepergig.com/](https://pricepergig.com/) \- a site to sort, filter, find all the cheapest hard disk drives, SSD and NVMe drives, order by price per GB/TB and now, get instant alerts so you get the cheapest prices.

The problem? Send email alerts to people with the current cheapest HDD, SSD, NVMe drive on their chosen Amazon store for their chosen threshold. e.g. I want amazon co uk hard disks, known brands, where they are less than £13/TB, don't send me anything more expensive than that.

I worked out, with about 8 amazon websites, known brands, unknown brands, HDD, SSD, and NVMe, that a total of 72 different 'lists' on something like Mailchimp (I don't know if it can do variables, Mautic can, but one look at the docs and I'm thinking, but Cursor can just do this).

ANYWAY - I'm a developer with super powers (aka Cursor) so I'll just write my own...

I use my spec document technique, and only 304 words, played on the xbox for 20 mins (I am terrible at Warzone), clicked 'accept' a bunch of times, went to make a cup of tea to review and BOOM, I had 'confirmation' emails AND a fully working 'alert' email. 

It would have taken me longer to make the two email templates alone! This is incredible .

Thanks @ Cursor.  


\# Only if you're interested, here are the prompts #

  
Using my spec document technique, I wrote the spec - and I'm cheating a bit here, I'm not including these words in the word count BECAUSE I'd have to a) write this for a human to implement or b) go read all the docs for mailchimp or mautic and click around for hours figuring it out, so this, imo, is less work than any of those.

    # Goal
    
    We want to send emails to users when they have certain thresholds of listings.
    
    # Features
    
    User's on the front end can subscribe to emails, at that point they choose the options they would like notifications for along with a price per TB or price per GB. threshold to be met.
    When the best price in that category is met, we send an email to the user with the listing details and link directly to the listing.
    
    We will store the users email address and preferences in a table.
    
    We need a front end for the user to manage their email preferences. 
    Users should have to double opt in / confirm their email address for it to become active on the list. 
    
    we should use the same react components for the user preferences as we do on the main site/subscribe component.
    
    we will also need a super simple front end looking component that takes just the user's email address. when a user enters their email address and a threshold price we should send that to the backend and store it in the database, then send the user a confirmation email, once the user confirms their email address we should update the user's status to active on the list. The user can then update their exact preferences.
    
    ## User preferences
    Users can choose from the following options to get notified for:
                ""nvme-m2"" - Cheapest NVMe M.2 SSD (any brand)
                ""nvme-m2-branded"" - Cheapest NVMe M.2 SSD (known branded)
                ""ssd-internal"" - Cheapest Internal SSD (any brand)
                ""ssd-internal-branded"" - Cheapest Internal SSD (known branded)
                ""hdd-internal"" - Cheapest Internal HDD (any brand)
                ""hdd-internal-branded"" - Cheapest Internal HDD (known branded)
    you will find we already calculate the best price for any item in the database in the pricepergig-backend-webapi/webapi/PPG.Services/BestListingService.cs file. we already have a webhook, we just need to add the logic to call an email service or similar there with the new best listing details - then the new notification service will handle the rest (find users that wanted that notification/threshold etc. and send them an email)
    
    Users can choose their language, but during the signup process we should just default to the currently selected language on the site (set in /ppg/pricepergig-frontend/src/Header.tsx and not need to ask the user this. they can change it on the larger preferences page later if they want to)
    
    
    ## User Interface components/things
    1 - simple sign up form - we get the users email address and the threshold price they want to be notified for.
    2 - confirmation email - we send a confirmation email to the user's email address, once they confirm their email address we update the user's status to active on the list. The user can then update their exact preferences.
    3 - preferences page - the user can update their exact preferences from this page, they can also unsubscribe from the list here.
    4 - unsubscribe link - the user can unsubscribe from the list from this page - but it will just take them to the preferences page.
    
    # Technologies
    
    We will use a hosted SMTP service to send the emails such as SendGrid, but we'll need the smtp details to configure this - they can be configured in the pricepergig-backend-webapi/webapi/EnvironmentVariables.cs file.
    
    We will use hangfire to handle the scheduling of the emails, this way we can 'fire and forget' and not have to keep the application running to send the emails as each time hangfire is started it will resume the emails job from where it left off.# Goal

And, this is my prompts, and if you read, you'll see, a good few prompts were because I had a file called EmailService already that didn't actually do anything other than send me one email each day so I knew the server was up and running.



1. update this file with the single storypoint tasks, make them a check list so that you can follow it later. you should read the codebase and make it clear what you can do - make a good PLAN you can execute later

1. Implement each of the # Single Storypoint Task in thsi file, you shoudl implement them and tick them off as you go. think hard, work methodically. complete the ENTIRE WORKLOAD - keep reminding yourself to look back at this task list and complete it.
2. the migration was created coontinue, you MUST update the Email list document tick boxes as you go

1. continue
2. hey, why don't you try building the back end and fixing the errors
3. try cd pricepergig-backend/webapi dotnet build
4. the problem is u/EmailService.cs and u/EmailService.cs I think the one in the utils folder should be renamed to EmailSenderService
5. ok, now run the new unit tests if you can, we've never done that before in here.
6. you don't need to mock them, just create them and use them and pass them in right? why mock something that dons't need mocking?
7. update this and write some simple instructions for me to test, e.g. i can't even 'see' the subscribe box
8. ok, you've used a new framework for api calls, axios . I think these api calls are simple, just use the native fetch apis go read u/App.tsx as to examples of us using this. now update your email code to use that on the front end so we don't need more libraries.
9. yeah do we need api.pricepergig.com? I don't know what that's about we always use 'baseurl'/api/ instead so can you follow the same, because otherwise that another domain to setup. perhaps you don't know how backened api is, it's just backend.pricepergig.com - api would have been better, but never mind, it's backend.pricepergig.com



I really need to get cursor to not go adding random frameworks, maybe a more complete # Technology section? How do you deal with that?

I use my spec document technique, and only 304 words, played on the xbox for 20 mins I am terrible at Warzone, clicked accept a bunch of times, went to make a cup of tea to review and BOOM, I had confirmation emails AND a fully working alert email. It would have taken me longer to make the two email templates alone! This is incredible . Thanks Cursor. Only if youre interested, here are the prompts Using my spec document technique, I wrote the spec and Im cheating a bit here, Im not including these words in the word count BECAUSE Id have to a write this for a human to implement or b go read all the docs for mailchimp or mautic and click around for hours figuring it out, so this, imo, is less work than any of those.

And, this is my prompts, and if you read, youll see, a good few prompts were because I had a file called EmailService already that didnt actually do anything other than send me one email each day so I knew the server was up and running. 1. update this file with the single storypoint tasks, make them a check list so that you can follow it later. you should read the codebase and make it clear what you can do make a good PLAN you can execute later 1. Implement each of the Single Storypoint Task in thsi file, you shoudl implement them and tick them off as you go. think hard, work methodically. complete the ENTIRE WORKLOAD keep reminding yourself to look back at this task list and complete it. 2. the migration was created coontinue, you MUST update the Email list document tick boxes as you go 1. continue 2. hey, why dont you try building the back end and fixing the errors 3. try cd pricepergigbackendwebapi dotnet build 4. the problem is uEmailService.cs and uEmailService.cs I think the one in the utils folder should be renamed to EmailSenderService 5. ok, now run the new unit tests if you can, weve never done that before in here. 6. you dont need to mock them, just create them and use them and pass them in right? why mock something that donst need mocking? 7. update this and write some simple instructions for me to test, e.g. i cant even see the subscribe box 8. ok, youve used a new framework for api calls, axios . I think these api calls are simple, just use the native fetch apis go read uApp.tsx as to examples of us using this. now update your email code to use that on the front end so we dont need more libraries. 9. yeah do we need api.pricepergig.com? I dont know what thats about we always use baseurlapi instead so can you follow the same, because otherwise that another domain to setup. perhaps you dont know how backened api is, its just backend.pricepergig.com api would have been better, but never mind, its backend.pricepergig.com I really need to get cursor to not go adding random frameworks, maybe a more complete Technology section?

1j17kgo,Quick Guide: Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP (talk to your database),"**Quick Guide: Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP**

If you're trying to hook up your Supabase database with Cursor (using MCP), here's a quick, straightforward guide. This setup lets you interact directly with your database through natural language—so you can just tell Cursor Composer what you want (like querying data, adding tables, etc.) without fiddling with manual SQL every time.

I struggled for hours last night because I skipped this step at first. Without this, Cursor just couldn't get accurate context from Supabase, even when I fed it the docs directly.

Here's what worked for me:

**Step 1: Get your Supabase connection string**

* Log in at [Supabase]() and pick your project.
* Head over to your project's connection settings.
* You’ll see a connection string there. Replace any placeholder passwords with your actual database password.
* Copy this entire connection string (you'll need it for Cursor).

**Step 2: Add your MCP server in Cursor**

* Open Cursor and navigate to Settings → Features.
* Scroll down past the ""Codebase indexing"" section until you see the MCP servers area.
* Click on **""Add New MCP Server""**.
   * Set type as **Command**.
   * Name it clearly (mine is just ""Supabase - My App"").
   * Paste the connection string you copied from Supabase here.
* Hit save.

**Step 3: Try it out**

* Now you can use Cursor Composer or similar tools to run queries directly against your Supabase database without leaving Cursor.
* Run a quick test (like asking it for a list of tables) to make sure it's connected properly.

Quick tip from experience—make sure you back up your database first. I didn't, and cleaning up mistakes afterwards took ages.

Hope this saves someone else the headache!

1j7wv39,A Deep Dive into Cursor Rules (> 0.45),"# Understanding Cursor Rules Deeply

Hi guys! After diving into Cursor 0.45’s Rules mechanism, I discovered that the official documentation is incomplete. It hints at certain concepts but doesn’t align with our intuition, leading to misunderstandings for beginners. This article provides an in-depth explanation of the Rules system and its principles. Feel free to discuss if you have questions.

# User Rules

User Rules define global preferences, like the desired tone, how the model addresses you, and principles for communication. These rules follow the editor and apply across all projects. User Rules are always sent to the AI in all chat sessions and conversations triggered by pressing Command-K.

# Project Rules

# Purpose

Project Rules are project-specific, designed to align with the needs of individual projects. Cursor organizes them as `.mdc` files in a structured system that automatically creates directories and files when new rules are added.

    └── .cursor
        └── rules
            ├── global.mdc
            └── only-html.mdc

An `.mdc` file is plain text with content that looks like this:

    ---
    description: Always apply in any situation
    globs: 
    alwaysApply: true
    ---
    
    When this rule loads, input: ""Rule loaded: global.mdc.""

# Editing Limitations

Cursor offers an integrated but buggy UI for editing `.mdc` files, which hasn’t been fixed yet. Editing these files with external tools like VSCode is recommended.

# Why Store Them in .cursor/rules/?

1. They integrate into the codebase.
2. Files in `.cursor` can be committed to Git repositories.
3. Teams can collaborate using shared rules, ensuring consistency as everyone pulls the same rules.

# How Do Project Rules Work?

* Do rules placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory automatically activate? **No.**
* Do the same rules apply equally across ask/edit/agent modes? **No.**

# Two Stages of Activation in Cursor

# Stage 1: Injection

Rules are injected into the system prompt context but aren’t yet active. Whether a rule is injected depends on:

1. `alwaysApply` : Injects the rule into the context unconditionally, but **does not control activation** .
2. `globs` : Matches files based on patterns (e.g., filenames, extensions). If matched, the rule is injected into the context. Again, this **does not control activation** .

# Stage 2: Activation

Whether a rule takes effect depends on its `description` field.

Cursor appends the following structure to the system prompt:

    <available_instructions>
    
    Cursor rules are user-provided instructions for the AI to follow to help work with the codebase.
    
    They may or may not be relevant to the task at hand. If they are, use the fetch_rules tool to fetch the full rule.
    
    Some rules may automatically attach to the conversation if the user links a file matching the rule's glob; those won't need to be fetched.
    
    # RULES_1.name: RULES_1.description
    
    # RULES_2.name: RULES_2.description
    
    </available_instructions>
    
    <cursor_rules_context>
    
    Cursor Rules are extra documentation provided by the user to help the AI understand the codebase.
    
    Use them if they seem useful to the user's most recent query, but do not use them if they seem unrelated.
    
    # RULES_1
    
    # RULES_2
    
    </cursor_rules_context>

That's the key prompt `Use them if they seem useful to the user's most recent query, but do not use them if they seem unrelated.`

# Key Points About Activation:

1. `description` : The `description` defines the appropriate scenarios, and the model will evaluate the context to decide whether the rule should be applied., such as:

* Always active in all situations.
* Active during planning discussions.
* Active for frontend projects.
* Etc.

1. **AI Intelligence Required** : The model must have sufficient intelligence to properly interpret the `description`. Less capable models (e.g., GPT-4-mini) may fail to understand and apply the rules effectively.

# Summary

For Project Rules to work as intended, you must understand how these parameters interact:

1. `alwaysApply` : Suitable for global rules.
2. `globs` : Matches files or directories based on naming patterns.
3. `description` : Determines activation during conversations by instructing the model through natural language.

Understanding these combinations ensures seamless rule integration in your workflows.",2025-03-10 04:55:18,78,13,0.97,cursor,WalrusCommercial4359,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j7wv39/a_deep_dive_into_cursor_rules_045/,"A Deep Dive into Cursor Rules (> 0.45) # Understanding Cursor Rules Deeply

    This project has three primary containers orchestrated by docker compose.

    ALL Django CLI commands should be preceded by `docker compose exec web`. For example:


    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```

    Becomes:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations
    ```

    All database commands should be preceded by `docker compose exec db`. For example:

    ```bash
    psql -U postgres my_project < db_backup.sql
    ```

    Becomes:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec db psql -U postgres my_project < db_backup.sql

    All Celery commands should be preceded by `docker compose exec celery`. For example:

1) Not being able to simply drag and drop the relevant files from the file tree into the Cascade/Chat.

2) Having no clear distinction of the chat and the cascade, whereas in cursor, I had those two nicely separated.

That's something that I'm missing as well.

3) Sometimes when cascades builds something out and when I click to see the code it has written, it doesn't even highlight. So it was very hard to see what exactly changed

4) In cursor, the sidebar is actually sitting on top of the file tree explorer. Is there any way to change it back to the top like it is in cursor?  I feel like that part takes off a significant amount of screen real estate in a sense that it can cut off some file namings and I have to decrease my code view.



What I like about Windsurf:

1) Better clarity on the token usage.

2) The UI looks very clean and nice and the branding is growing on me.

3) Deepseek v3 free

4) minor aspects of the experience that makes you feel that they are much more polising the product, whereas it feels as cursor might be experiencing an increasing level of bureacracy.

5) Better pricing and high usage tier.
