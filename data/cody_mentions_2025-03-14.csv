1ins9ok,API calls for checking/triggering sync times,"I have an Enterprise Starter account. Was able to bring in repos hosted in my github account, great! 

I can't tell how often Sourcegraph updates itself from Github. Do I have to setup webhooks? Where can I check/verify the last update times? Can I trigger a sync for some/all my repositories? It looks like GraphQL is the API choice, are there API calls for these operations?",2025-02-12 06:38:21,1,0,1.0,sourcegraph,Creative-Drawer2565,True,Reddit (r/sourcegraph),https://www.reddit.com/r/sourcegraph/comments/1ins9ok/api_calls_for_checkingtriggering_sync_times/

I recall using it a few years ago and was wowed but I can't remember it now.",2025-02-22 05:21:55,1,0,1.0,vscode,hoffeig,True,Reddit (r/vscode),https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/1ivilon/looking_for_an_extension_but_cant_remember_what/
