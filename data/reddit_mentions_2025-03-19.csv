Caveat: likely not work for anyone else - Sorry

I had this happen to me today, the write\_file tool worked fine, but the edit\_file tool failed everytime.

They showed up as ReparsePoint in my filesystem:

Solution for me was to not have the files live in a dropbox folder, and move them to a ""simple"" folder.

I got it all moved over the a simple folder, and then it worked fine for me immediately.

Wanted to set up a automated self-hosted Gitlab in WSL, but then I ran out of flow credits and now I am seriously thinking I should just do it manually like a common coder :D

I was to be honest leaning on Windsurf to do things that I could just as easily do myself, so I guess it is fair I lost all of my credits.

1jd7fop,Karpathy completely changed the way I use Windsurf,"I’ve been coding for years, but I never realized how much time I wasted typing until I stumbled on a video of Karpathy coding entirely with his voice. I thought it was just a gimmick. But turns out, dictating prompts for Windsurf works super well and a lot faster than typing. 



It lets me articulate longer prompts without breaking flow and it’s easier describing logical flows. Apparently 3x faster on average compared to typing. For example, dictating a complex API query prompt now takes seconds of braindumping with my voice instead of minutes.



In the past couple weeks, I’ve tried 3 different ones. 



1. Apple Dictation. This was my first attempt. Let’s just say it didn’t go well. The accuracy isn’t good and latency is terrible. Half the time, I’d finish speaking and stare at the screen waiting for the text to appear, only to realize it had given up halfway through. Only good thing is that it’s free and built-in
2. Dragon Dictation. Sorry, maybe it’s because I’m Unc now. I only realized no one even uses this after paying hundreds of dollars. It used to be really good in the past but no longer supports Mac and has gone downhill since getting acquired by Microsoft. It’s nice for controlling your entire computer but hard to learn. Just doesn’t keep up with the new AI dictation tools
3. WillowVoice. This is the one I current use and I like it. Accuracy is good. Latency is less than a second. It works everywhere and can automatically format an email when I write them. Not much to complain about.



Anyone else tried this? I’m curious if other devs have relaced more of their typing with dictation.

1j9pd4b,Windsurf burns through credits by continuously correcting itself,"In this state this hardly more than a fun gimmick. I've tried four different project types now (composing a bash script, setting op a small Spring Boot project, setting up a React/Zustand based web UI and some CUDA code) and in all cases it just loses track once you get beyond even the smallest of setups. As I type this it's in a 20 step flow of fixing a bash script, run it, see a problem, claim it fixed it, run it, same problem, tries variant it already tried. Whatever the combination of memory, attention and model is causing this behavior is unclear to me. I've upgraded a few hours ago and I've burnt through 15% of my total monthly budget. And that's ignoring the fact that it bails on generating edits about 30% of the time with an error (I suspect due to the large size of the scripts it created and them being too large an amount of input tokens for an edit or just service outages, hard to say). Is anyone actually using this for production level codebases? Also, any model other than Claud is doing this thing where it suggests a fix without actually editing the files until you tell it something like ""do it"". 

P.S. It would be an interesting optimization to have some sort of (non LLM/ML based) short term history of generated content so it can avoid burning credits on generating the same command line invocations over and over again.

It used to work then I stopped using Windsurf for a month and now I need it again and it doesn't run commands anymore. i don't know if i changed something on my mac to cause it.

    $ $ cat /Users/_______/Development/_______/.git/config

Exit Code 130Not auto-runThought Process

I'm getting exit code 130 when trying to run commands, which typically indicates the command was terminated with SIGINT (Ctrl+C). Let me try a simpler approach with less invasive commands to understand the issue.

I notice there's an issue running some of the commands. Let me try a different approach to help diagnose your git remote issue.

Ran terminal command

    ~/Development/________

Go to terminal

    $ pwd

Exit Code 130

I can see the commands are actually running in the terminal when I view it there, just it gets INT x

─    \~/Development/\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_    master ──────────────────────────────────────────────────── INT ✘  07:49:33 PM  ─╮

╰─ git remote -v                                                                                                            ─╯

origin  D:/GitServer/\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.git (fetch)

origin  D:/GitServer/\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.git (push)

So it is able to run the command and display the output of the command in the terminal but then it gets this INT error and everytime Cascade says it got Exit Code 130 instead of doing productive tasks.

1jbz4j3,i figured out how to open a wsl folder from the command line in windsurf,"it's much more esoteric than opening with vscode.

note that just opening a wsl terminal and typing `windsurf .` won't work, at least for me (it opens the folder but doesn't connect to remote).

here's the **powershell command**:

`wsl windsurf --folder-uri ""vscode-remote://wsl+ubuntu/$(wsl wslpath -a 'C:\\your\\folder\\path')""`

# right-click menu

i also use **nilesoft shell** to customize my right-click menu. here's my setup for both windsurf, vscode, and opening in terminal; replace the `image=...` with your own icon paths:

    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir' title='Open in Code' cmd='code' arg=`@sel.path\.` image=image.svgf('C:\icons\vscode.svg'))
    
    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir|file' title='Open in Code (WSL)' cmd='wsl' arg=`code $(wslpath -a '@sel.path')` image=\uE272 window=hidden)
    
    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir' title='Open in Windsurf' cmd='windsurf' arg=`@sel.path\.` image=image('C:\icons\windsurf.png') window=hidden)
    
    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir' title='Open in Windsurf (WSL)' cmd='wsl' arg=`windsurf --folder-uri vscode-remote://wsl+ubuntu$(wslpath -a '@sel.path')` image=image('C:\icons\windsurf.png') window=hidden)
    
    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir' title='Open in Windows Terminal' cmd='wt' arg=`-d ""@sel.path\.""` image=\uE218)
    
    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir' title='Open in WSL Bash' cmd='wt' arg=`-d ""@sel.path\."" Ubuntu run` directory=sel.path image=\uE0D6)

# edit: 

fixed slight mistake with the windsurf nilesoft shell command, it only supports folders in wsl. also more explanation

# edit2:

if you want to make it connect when you type `wf .` you probably have to write your own script and set it as an alias, something like

    #!/bin/bash
    windsurf --folder-uri vscode-remote://wsl+ubuntu/$1

and then alias it

    echo 'alias wf=""~/bin/windsurf-helper.sh""' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

(bash script and alias are untested)

But I’m coming to the realization that it’s just not really possible to have it al right now. 

You can get similar output with significant price reductions by planning every step and executing with aider and R1+Claude. But that’s a lot more effort. 

You can use Claude code and get unbelievable results. But you pay for it. 

You can create your own experience in roo or cline. And find some middle ground between control , customization and automation. But you’re juggling cost and effort here too. 

There’s no real solution atm that I’ve found that is as streamlined as cursor or windsurf that’s comparable in price, regardless of how annoying credits are. 

Until I actually build my own chain of agents that can offload the time I spend crafting the prompt context and plan I use to push Aider to the limits, it’s really hard to complain about cursor or windsurf. 

Even vscode api cline still limits me periodically. 

All this to say, I choose to pay to play. But the value you get from all of the subscription services is really high and I’m pretty sure all of them run at a loss.

mibf2lj,,"I take a contrarian view (it's kinda my jam, you could say).

In the grand scheme of things, AI coding is cheap. Admittedly that's from a privileged position. I make a decent(ish) income and live in a developed country. And even then it's expensive enough to make me wince at how much I'm spending.

But in return I'm getting some scrappy MVPs and some functional pieces of software that do things I've always wanted. if even one of these were professionally developed it would likely cost more than my cumulative spend to date.

What's not cheap (and this is my point in writing this, should anyone read this comment): my time.

During the honeymoon phase I could justify pulling a few all-nighters to babysit Cascade and patiently try to steer it clear of its latest round of self-destruction to ultimately achieve something half-usable. But that's not a sustainable approach.

It's been a really interesting experience, but I have to admit that I'm beginning to feel a bit lukewarm as to the state of the technology at the moment. There's potential for greatness undoubtedly. But it feels like the tech and context handling particularly needs 6 to 12 months of slow brewing to reach any kind of justifiable maturity. 

I think that what Codeium has achieved so far borders on genius. But I think that until the technology is at a place of much more stability, they would do well to charge a little less and be a little more cautious in their approach. ",2025-03-17 15:59:15,1,0,0.0,Codeium,danielrosehill,False,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1jcmzw7/i_dont_mean_to_be_a_shill_but_have_you_considered/mibf2lj/

What's ""expensive""? A single green human dev starts at 10k a month. Between me and the model, I'm outperforming large teams at this point. I normally had 3 or 4 full time guys so 40 to 60k a month, and by myself I'm vastly more productive. Windsurf makes me insane for a few reasons, and man it has its bad days...

Due to the magic of venture capital Anthropic sells it at a loss, Codeium buys it at a discount and then further subsidizes it. (Or close to). This is why both companies despite being hugely successful are burning venture cash.

So the deal isn't as bad as it seems.

mhmq4bd,,"the balance is definitely off. not to mention all the times it gets enchanted: you used up the prompt, you used up credits in analysis and then the AI ​​doesn't write code... which was exactly the goal for which you used up the previous credits.
I defended Windsurf tooth and nail until yesterday... but I'm having second thoughts... the spark ignited when I saw the post about the context, posted by a developer of the team.
I mean... first of all, who is it that claims that Windsurf's context is the best? I would really like to read the posts of these people, since I have read much more often of people who, having used both Windsurf and Cursor, say that Cursor holds the context better. Second... We are saying here that Windsurf can't call half an instrument successfully, and that the credits are burned... and you tell us that you are working on the context? The context is not the relevant problem at the moment. Getting a giant context will be useless if the tools never work and credits are still being burned, these are the things to take care of, at the top of the list of priorities. The context can always be managed one way or another... But a tool that doesn't work: it just doesn't work.
So I'm starting to wonder if the Codeium team is really a good investment for me...
There are some things I love about their product, the interface, the transparency... (in Cursor you have a harder time understanding how the models work and there is no way to see the consumption, except going to your account in the browser) but Cursor simply works better. The terminal is more responsive. The error rate of Claude 3.5 is close to 0, while with Windsurf, I'm not saying it's not a great model, but it fails a lot more, needs more fixes... which will make you consume more credits...
So whatever the difference under the hood, between Windsurf and Cursor, I guess in Cursor they are currently managing things better. Not to mention the business model... In Cursor there is no flow action, you have your 500 quick prompts and then you continue slowly, with the same model, without worrying about having to buy Flex credits or running out of flow action credits. so I am honestly undecided at this point, whether to renew with Windsurf or pay Cursor. what kept me attached to Windsurf, were basically 3 things: 
1. it was the first agentic IDE I tried, so it is the one I know most deeply. 
2. I see positive and negative comments on any software, so I thought that switching from Windsurf to something else would not solve my problems. 
3. I had problems before, with Cursor, and I thought it was a Cursor problem then I realized that it had nothing to do with it and the problem was with my system, so I was able to try it, I'm trying it right now... in one day I did what I did in two weeks in Windsurf.",2025-03-13 16:39:39,2,0,0.0,Codeium,[deleted],False,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1jai2m5/flow_action_credits_disappear_faster_than_my/mhmq4bd/

There’s been a lot of talk recently about how Windsurf’s context retrieval is better than other products. One rebuttal I’ve seen is that all products “index your codebase”.

But indexing code ≠ context retrieval. It is necessary but not sufficient.

Thought I’d share a bit about what we’re doing under the hood to get the best results.

Indexing & embedding search is a tablestakes RAG technique. Btw, even for this technique there are approaches that make this more or less effective. One thing we are doing is AST parsing code and chunking along semantically meaningful boundaries - not random blocks of code. This means that when a code chunk is retrieved, it is a full function or class, not just an arbitrary block of consecutive code.

But embedding search becomes unreliable as a retrieval heuristic as the size of the codebase grows. Instead, we must rely on a combination of techniques like grep/file search, knowledge graph based retrieval, and more. With all these heuristics, a re-ranking step also becomes needed where the retrieved context is ranked in order of relevance. We use LLM based reranking under the hood.

“Varun did you just give away your secret sauce??”

No. This is all known. The reason other products don’t do this is simple: latency. This multidimensional retrieval takes a lot of compute and thus time. The reason Windsurf can do it is because we have spent years investing in building the best GPU infrastructure. After all, we literally started off as a GPU workload optimization company called Exafunction…so we know a thing or two about this 🙂

Hopefully this helps clear the air and explain why those who are testing us side-by-side with other products on small test codebases are getting comparable results. Try us out with a larger repo, and the difference will become clear.",2025-03-13 10:09:08,27,4,0.97,Codeium,Ordinary-Let-4851,True,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1jactfd/context_retrieval_thread/

1jdzd0p,Looping in proposal mode,"Just a heads up. 

Was doing some work earlier today (GMT+1) and Cascade kept looping solutions with minor changes each time, before repeating the privous solutions again. 

Solution quality is also sub par. Have only tested with sonnet 3.7 (normal). So don't know where the underlying cause for the performance drop is.

This wasn't the case yesterday. Yesterday cascade was working perfectly with all LLM models. Providing 90% hit rate solutions from prompts and not looping. 

Would be interesting to know if these are things that happen as frequently in cursor and other IDE'S. Or if it is more of a windsurf specific issue.

1jagphd,Theory on the cause of the widespread issues,"My theory on what caused the widespread issues:

The Windsurf team recently shipped an auto-fix-lint-errors thing. I assume this doesn't use the super-premium models, and instead routes to some other service. But they underestimated just how much load / credits / etc. would be taken by the lint-fixing loop.

I think their API load may have > doubled due to the lint fixing feature, and it's a kind of find-the-bottleneck-in-production type of devops issue.

  
This is also coupled with Claude 3.7 being optimized for evals, which favor smaller incremental edits - but this comes at the cost of tokens & usage etc.

So both Claude 3.7 and the auto-fix-lint-errors likely caused larger-than-ancitipated spikes.

I hope to see Windsurf improve and become the tool we're all waiting for, but right now Cursor is just better, whatever the reasons...

1jbv6yw,Is there a way to disable Cascade memories?,"So Cascade Memories seems like a nice idea in theory, however in practice I've begun to find it really troublesome. 

For example, I've recently been working on a few Docker-based Dev Ops projects for deployments of various stacks onto servers and have been using Windsurf to expedite the tedious process of writing multiple Docker Compose files. On the surface, they look like very similar ""things"", but each one is a completely different project with very unique requirements.

One of the stacks (an AI stack) used Langflow. Comically, until it became hugely frustrating, Codeium decided that Langflow should be called ""LandGraph"" and botched the docker-compose and .env by referring to the wrong project. 

I thought that I had finally exorcised ""Landgraph"" from my life but alas, working on a completely different project a week later, Cascade has decided that my current (unrelated) project must be the same thing as I was working on a week ago. Apparently, a memory had been formed along the lines of ""the user uses Landgraph"".

Thus, while executing one of its flows, I noticed that Cascade had taken the executive decision that ""LandGraph"" needed to be added back to this project. Not for the first time, I found myself writing angrily in all caps to a bot: ""THERE IS NO LANDGRAPH. WTH ARE YOU DOING!?!?""

If I can be a little cheeky I suggest again to pay attention to what many users here seem to be saying: there's rough around the edges, but it seems like many of these features just haven't had basic QA-ing. I'm all in favor of the product and its imaginative uses, but bugs like these really detract from trying to really get stuff done with it.",2025-03-15 09:32:48,7,0,1.0,Codeium,danielrosehill,True,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1jbv6yw/is_there_a_way_to_disable_cascade_memories/
1jcnygr,RANT: I just want it to work...,"I'm on 1.4.6 and I don't understand why it takes so long to copy anything? Before starting this post I cut a line from the document and pasted it to a new line. In the time that I have pulled up reddit and written this post I'm still looking at the stupid progress circle spin as it thinks about if it's actually going to paste the content. I already had to stop my conversation and start a new one since the delay for trying to type anything in the Cascade window was getting stupid long. Even though I see that the typing delay has been an issue for multiple months? Starting a new conversation fixed the delay, but now I have a dumb Cascade that is making mistakes all the time because it doesn't know about the prior conversations we have had.

Hey, it finally finished the paste function like 3 or 4 minutes later. 

While I appreciate some of what has been accomplished like being being able to consistently execute terminal functions without getting stuck like Cursor does, please figure out a way to manage context length.  Having to tell Cascade to think sequentially and break edits down into smaller segments when it is only trying to add a couple hundred line edit is really becoming frustrating since I shouldn't be anywhere near Claude 3.7's response context limit length. This significantly increases the time it takes for anything to be accomplished. Especially when it can't find the end of the file that it just created from the sequential edit during it's last action. 

Just last night when it couldn't figure out how to find the last line in the file, it started making edits in a 2 step terminal command process where it created a temp file and then applied that temp file to the end of the target file as a second terminal command. This chewed though a bunch of flow credits before I figured out what it was doing. I've settled on telling it to look at the last couple of lines in the end of a file before trying to perform the edit a second time if the first time fails due to a syntax issue. But this is yet another thing that slows any progress down.

Again, I generally like Windsurf as an AI coding agent. But I find myself just making extra global rules in an attempt to fix all of the issues it has. It seems like rules should be for tailoring the AI agent to how you like to work, not as a way to fix issues that the program has that make it difficult to be productive with it.

mi66n4q,,"What I'm saying is not contradictory. I just didn't want to muddy the waters of the OPs post. I've been a happy Cursor user for a couple of months now. Most of my work goes in to the ""Included In Pro"" bucket on my usage. I'm predominately using Claud Sonnet 3.7 unless it gets stuck on something and I switch to OpenAI for a different viewpoint to the problem. I can maintain a high level of productivity with Cursor generating many times my regular output with it's assistance. The only 2 issues that I have with it are that I can't get an MCP to work on it despite applying the solutions on the web and that as a windows user, it is inconsistent on being able to run terminal commands. Sometimes it hangs and I have to override and run it manually. When I spent 2 days trying to fix something on my server getting frustrated with the terminal command issues I opened a Windsurf account and was able to fix the problem with Cascade's help in a couple of hours. 

So the one thing that I've found that Windsurf does better for me is terminal commands.

I then used Windsurf for 3 days using up over half of the flow-credit. Windsurf's response window is extremely limited requiring the creation of a rule to break long file edits into multiple smaller edits so that they stayed within the context window limitations. This caused me to significantly reduce the amount of progress I was making since what should have taken 1 update often turned into 2-4 updates. Then I ran into the problem that it would forget what the previous sequential update ended in which would cause the next update to fail repeatedly causing me to have to create a rule that if it is doing a sequential update to a file and it didn't remember the last couple rows from the previous update that it should search for the last couple of rows and then apply the update. At one point it started sending my edits to a temp file as a terminal command and then applying the contents of the file in another terminal command. 

During this whole process my typing was starting to lag in the cascade window and I gradually noticed that I was getting a progress indicator when trying to paste into the code pane. Both these issue got worse until this morning when I was typing full sentences into the Cascade input and then waiting for them to appear and the I pasted a line of text to move it's location and after waiting 30 seconds I went on reddit to search is anyone else was having a similar problem. By the time I had been typing my post for a couple of minutes it still hadn't finished my paste command. I later did some searching and discovered that this lag issue has been a know bug for over 2 months.

Now I know that as long as I don't need to do something terminal command intensive, Cursor works great for what I need and Windsurf doesn't.

So what I was trying to say in my original post wasn't that it wasn't worth $235 to use a tool that met my needs. In the end, Windsurf and Cursor are just a tacked on module to VS Code to expose an LLM to a user for assisted code editing.

migulej,,"I'll try to clear up any confusion with the credit system for using premium models with Cascade:

1. User Prompt credits vs Flow Action credits:
   * User Prompt credits are consumed for each message prompt sent with a premium model.
   * Flow Action credits are consumed for each tool call (e.g., View file, Search, Write, Terminal).
2. Options when out of Flow Action credits but have User Prompt credits:
   * Purchase premium Flex credits to continue using premium features.
   * Use Write or Chat mode with the Cascade Base model (no credits used).
   * Use Legacy mode to use premium User Prompt credits without Flow Action credits.
3. Flex credits:
   * These are versatile credits that can be used as both User Prompt and Flow Action credits.
   * They act as a backup when you run out of either type of credit.

Other ways to utilize AI assistance without using credits:

mhf5r5x,,"Full transparency I work at Cline, but wanted to share my perspective:

Checkpoints are very effective in Cline, especially after our recent 2.0 update, which significantly boosted speed and drastically reduced storage needs.

One key difference is that Cline is usage-based instead of subscription-based (i.e. Cline's not cutting corners on your inference). This means it actively seeks more relevant context from your codebase and engages with you directly, creating a more responsive, agentic experience. However, depending on your usage (especially with 3.7 Sonnet), costs might exceed a fixed monthly subscription like Cursor's $20/month. A solid cost-saving alternative is leveraging high-quality yet more affordable models from DeepSeek or Gemini.

Regarding MCP, Cline has some underrated capabilities here. There's an integrated marketplace allowing you to easily connect to hundreds of servers. Additionally, Cline excels in building MCP servers—I've even created a .clinerules protocol designed specifically to simplify building custom MCP servers (https://docs.cline.bot/mcp-servers/mcp-server-from-scratch).

Overall, there's amazing innovation happening in this space right now. Cursor, Windsurf, and Cline are all bringing unique strengths to the table.

1jcvee5,cursor alternatives,"Hi

I was wondering what others are using to help them code other than cursor. Im a low level tech - 2 yrs experience and have noticed since cursor updated its terrible like absolutely terrible. i have paid them too much money now and am disappointed with their development. What other IDE's with ai are people using? Ive tried roocode, it ate my codebase, codeium for QA is great but no agent. Please help. Oh and if you work for cursor, what the hell are you doing with those stupid updates?!",2025-03-16 16:50:43,5,23,1.0,ChatGPTCoding,bizfounder1,True,Reddit (r/ChatGPTCoding),https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1jcvee5/cursor_alternatives/

mi8ctgj,,"Trae is an option beside windsurf but i am really not sure if they are using sonnet-3.5 or using some hosted LLMs.

yesterday i gave functional requirements md to it and asked to work on them....it worked on few basic things then stopped making progress.  
gave same functional requirements md file to cursor agent and it started working non-stop....

at this point, i felt....probably they are faking model or their prompting is very bad (as they are trying to save bucks)",2025-03-17 05:19:31,1,0,0.0,ChatGPTCoding,Either-Nobody-3962,False,Reddit (r/ChatGPTCoding),https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1jcvee5/cursor_alternatives/mi8ctgj/
1jb6ncp,Getting tired of switching!,"Looking for a definitive response around stick to cursor, windsurf, etc. or roo-cline.

  
1. Cursor seems to be great, in general, but you never know what you are missing until you try other tools

2. Augment is great, i like how it asks the me on selectively applying code updates, so you are still in control on what changes are being done, and how its making it. Unlike all other tools that use these new diff patterns and auto approve, are more for vibe coding when you don't care and just need the project done (for proof of concepts, pilots, and experimentation type work)

3. Cost wise, roo-cline to be really productive is costing more than cursor actually if you select the good models (and free versions on openrouter suck in terms of network timeouts, plus cline really does not favor any other models except claude)

4. Share your experiences please. Are you generally happy with one over the other? why?",2025-03-14 11:31:45,8,16,1.0,ChatGPTCoding,8thcross,True,Reddit (r/ChatGPTCoding),https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1jb6ncp/getting_tired_of_switching/
mi54c2f,,"In all fairness, this reminds of an era where bitcoin was mainly dominant and every altcoin on the market were full of promises to beat BTC in terms of value, payment of choice etc. 

Now it's the same case with every AI powered code editor or extensions. By all means I'm up for alternatives, but even the competition between roo Vs cline, windsurf Vs cursor gives me similar vibes. 

The only major difference from my findings so far, lying with LLMs. The more abilities LLM get, we will see more extensions and other set of tools in the market(MCPs right now) 

So, my humble suggestion would be just choosing one or two of them and stick to them, unless something really groundbreaking hits the market(Like native multi agent IDEs with verification and all)",2025-03-16 15:54:48,1,0,0.0,ChatGPTCoding,kthraxxi,False,Reddit (r/ChatGPTCoding),https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1jb6ncp/getting_tired_of_switching/mi54c2f/

1j9ibof,Thinking of switching from Cursor,"What features does Cursor have that are missing in other AI IDE's/extensions such as Trae, Windsurf, Cline (Rules, MCP, Checkpoints, etc)?

I'm considering switching from Cursor. Checkpoints aren't working for me and there have been reports of the models not functioning effectively through Cursor (I think Cursor edits/abbreviates messages in the backend to save their API costs). Apparently a lot of the issues came after 4.5 update.

1jbtswp,Which AI tools/models do you use for which tasks?,"There are more AI tools out there than stars in the sky (at least it feels that way 😅). To be honest, I'm starting to lose track:

* Which LLM/AI tool do you use for **brainstorming**?
* Which one for **architecting**?
* Which one for **writing code**?
* Which one for **refactoring & debugging**?
* And do you run any **local models** to leverage your NPU? (Deepseek r1 eg)

I started learning JavaScript four months ago (and I will go on) —lots of **trial and error** and countless ""Why isn't this working?!"" moments. 😅 At the same time, I’ve been closely following AI developments. Every week, a new tool drops, and people claiming to be **the best thing ever**.

So, **what's your approach?** Do you use **ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Windsurf – or do you have hidden gems?** Do you switch tools depending on the task, or do you have a **go-to setup**?

1jcspzy,Why aren’t there more tutorials on preparing design architecture which will be included for prompts used in Windsurf?,"Almost all tutorials focus on prompting for features rather than structuring the application’s architecture first.

Wouldn’t it make more sense to define the architecture (via a doc, diagram, or structured prompt file) so that the AI follows a predetermined structure rather than improvising each time?

For example:

What if we predefine the app’s core structure and ask the AI to follow it instead of relying on memory or previous chats?

Why is there little discussion about feeding architecture files (Word, HTML, etc.) into these tools to act as persistent references?

Is it just a gap in design experience, or are there limitations I’m missing?",2025-03-16 14:55:05,3,2,0.72,WindsurfAI,alwaysdefied,True,Reddit (r/WindsurfAI),https://www.reddit.com/r/WindsurfAI/comments/1jcspzy/why_arent_there_more_tutorials_on_preparing/
