If i request a feature or a bug fix, Cascade will inevitably look for the files and information that is need within the actual codebase. I have been developing my app for quite some time without any problems, iterating, improving and i \"feel\" that if you are good with prompting, Cascade will get everything it needs by itself within the codebase.

A regular user. But this is the biggest issue that keeps bothering me. And it's a serious software issue rather than AI related.\n\nIf you add some changes using cascade, and approve the changes. Then work on the file, and for some need do an Undo, If your undo passes when the cascade change got applied, it messes everything up. The apply change pannel pops up. And if you try to redo to get back to where you were, your undo redo history is wipped.\n\nAnd what is far worse, the apply change pannel appears on all other files that were affected by the cascade change. You don't even know what to do, as you cant even have \"Accept all\" button. You won't know which changes are legit, whether to accept or reject, which one keeps your work progress in undo\/redo history...\n\nIt is like a messy trip wire that messes everything up if you pass the undo level on any of the changed files.\n\nI have been having this issue for sometime, and thought \"I might have to learn how to predict its behaviour and mange this\". That was until today, after i made changes affecting more than 27 files with consecutive prompts, ready to git commit, and when i was manually adjusting some things in a small affected file, when doing some undo, it suddenly passed the cascade change applied undo\/redo history, and the cascade apply changes pannel appeared on all the recently affected files, I was shocked as i didn't commit, tried to do redo to get back to where I was. It had deleted all my redo history, all changes i wrote were gone. Even worse, I don't know which files got affected by the apply request. beyond what i can track based on their dependency. After carefully trying to understand, approve changes. It was completely unpredictable, even erasing full file changes for newly generated files. No undo\/redo. Files directly changed at disk. I gave up and decided to come write this after losing long hours this way. Reminds me of the pain you fill when you accidentally do a git reset with --hard\n\nThe worst part, when you do an Undo, it doesn't affect the file being edited, it rather makes changes on disk.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this issue with redo\/undo on Windsurf?","created_at":"2025-03-02 04:02:48","source":"Reddit (r\/Codeium)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Codeium\/comments\/1j1pcsz\/biggest_issue_in_windsurf\/","sentiment_label":"Negative","sentiment_score":-0.9817,"author":"u\/Powishiswilfre","platform_specific_metrics":"{\"score\": 3, \"num_comments\": 3, \"upvote_ratio\": 1.0, \"is_post\": true}","keywords_found":"[\"windsurf\"]"},{"id":"1j1p574","text":"A bug or?

Any options?\n\nIf not, I'm thinking about trying to get Windsurf to create one although as I have zero prior experience in VS Code extension development I'm not too optimistic about my chances.\n\nIn \"regular\" VS Code, there's some built in speech-to-text stuff that doesn't provide too much info about what it's actually using, but AFAIK it's server-side\/cloud STT (ie, it's not doing STT via a local Whisper instance, etc)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/55c0icpv6qle1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4e162e7c93276c8e3bd91217b217ab19a113ec6\n\nIt's not *amazing* (hence I'm fairly sure that it's not any variant of Whisper under the hood). But it is accurate enough that I can create a \"development prompt\" by opening up a markdown doc and just dictating into it. Which I've come to find highly effective.\n\nSadly, the Whisper landscape on Linux is a little less evolved and tools for real time STT into any text field are fairly scant.\n\nIf it helps to elucidate the use-case:\n\nI've never used speech-to-text for actual development, although I know that that's a popular thing to do and there are separate plugins that try to provide a bridge between natural language and coding languages.\n\nRather, I just find it a very effective way of speeding up the process of writing things like development prompts, debugging instructions, feature edits, and other text documents that I use as a shorthand for providing instructions in an easier way than trying to cram everything into the text box.\u00a0\n\nOnce I have my prompt typed I then just type something like \"try to start creating the app I've outlined in \/outline.md\" and ... it works really well! Cascade quickly reads the markdown doc as context, takes it as its instruction, and gets to work. \n\nHence, pretty much any STT plugin that lets you go voice -> text would be helpful.\n\nIf anyone knows of anything please LMK!","created_at":"2025-02-27 10:37:32","source":"Reddit (r\/Codeium)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Codeium\/comments\/1izmy9b\/speech_to_text_for_windsurf_linux_any_options\/","sentiment_label":"Positive","sentiment_score":0.9928,"author":"u\/danielrosehill","platform_specific_metrics":"{\"score\": 1, \"num_comments\": 1, \"upvote_ratio\": 1.0, \"is_post\": true}","keywords_found":"[\"windsurf\"]"},{"id":1895054272720715937,"text":"RT @iamfakhrealam: Begin your journey now\n\nTry it here\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/ILfklKP51t","created_at":"2025-02-27 10:12:01","source":"Twitter","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MQuantum47052\/status\/1895054272720715937","sentiment_label":"Neutral","sentiment_score":0.0,"author":"@MQuantum47052","platform_specific_metrics":"{\"retweet_count\": 20, \"like_count\": 0, \"reply_count\": 0, \"verified_author\": false}","keywords_found":"[]"},{"id":1895053009471918245,"text":"Begin your journey now\n\nTry it here\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/ILfklKP51t","created_at":"2025-02-27 10:07:00","source":"Twitter","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/iamfakhrealam\/status\/1895053009471918245","sentiment_label":"Neutral","sentiment_score":0.0,"author":"@iamfakhrealam","platform_specific_metrics":"{\"retweet_count\": 20, \"like_count\": 27, \"reply_count\": 16, \"verified_author\": false}","keywords_found":"[]"},{"id":1895052895399354872,"text":"RT @iamfakhrealam: Step 1:\n\ud83c\udf10 Visit https:\/\/t.co\/ILfklKP51t\n\u2b07\ufe0f Download Windsurf Editor\n\nFeatures:\n\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Create apps with CascadeAI\n\ud83d\udd2e Intent pr\u2026","created_at":"2025-02-27 10:06:33","source":"Twitter","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MQuantum47052\/status\/1895052895399354872","sentiment_label":"Positive","sentiment_score":0.2732,"author":"@MQuantum47052","platform_specific_metrics":"{\"retweet_count\": 20, \"like_count\": 0, \"reply_count\": 0, \"verified_author\": false}","keywords_found":"[\"windsurf\"]"},{"id":"1izm6zy","text":"Feature request: disable autocomplete by file type\n\nI have a \"notes.md\" where I jot down notes and todo items for my project.

I am actually then having long conversations with Grok Voice or ChatGPT voice when I don't understand a concept - which ends up being a good learning\/tutorial experience.\n\nWhat I think I am coming to is that the context window of each chat session is limited and when it starts filling up, Claude starts making more mistakes or taking paths it may hallucinate and adding stuff that does not add value.\n\nSo I have begun using something I call 'seed prompts',  they are getting long now and probably consuming too much of the context window but it helps keep Claude more in line with the goals and recent history.  Not sure if this is a good idea or not - but it seems to help.  I then ask Claude to write the next seed prompt when the context window is over 70% full (something that should be in the Windsurf UI) and use that seed prompt on the next chat session.\n\nHere is an example of a recent seed prompt I used, I have Claude write me a new one based on the one the chat session started with and to add the recent work done in that session:\n\n    # The Juggler Personal CRM Development Seed Prompt\n    \n    ## Project Context\n    I'm working on \"The Juggler Personal CRM\", a Flask-based web application for managing personal contacts and relationships. The application uses:\n    - Python 3.11\n    - Flask framework\n    - SQLAlchemy for database operations\n    - Flask-Login for authentication & Social Logins with Google and Microsoft\n    - OAuth integration for Google and Microsoft login\n    - Gunicorn as the WSGI server (running on port 5015)\n    \n    ## Recent Progress\n    We've been debugging and fixing issues with the OAuth administration section:\n    \n    1. Fixed CSRF token handling in templates:\n       - Templates were incorrectly using `csrf_token()` as a function call\n       - Changed to `{{ csrf_token }}` (without parentheses) in multiple templates\n       - This ensures forms submit properly with valid CSRF tokens\n    \n    2. Fixed OAuth debug JSON API:\n       - Modified the debug_oauth route to return JSON when requested via AJAX\n       - Added detection for AJAX requests using X-Requested-With header\n       - This resolved the \"Error loading configuration data\" issue on test pages\n    \n    ## Current Status\n    - The debug version of the OAuth admin page is now loading correctly\n    - We have not yet verified if the original OAuth admin page is functioning properly\n    - Debug pages are working and will be kept until we fully solve the main login page\n    - We plan to eventually consolidate debug pages into a health\/monitoring section\n    - Still need to test and ensure all buttons on the OAuth admin page work correctly\n    - Need to verify the complete login\/logout flow with the main login page\n    \n    ## Critical Challenge\n    We've encountered a persistent issue where fixing one component (OAuth admin or login page) breaks the other. This cycle has repeated approximately 10 times, consuming significant development time. Our primary goal is to break this cycle by:\n    - Implementing changes that maintain compatibility between both components\n    - Testing thoroughly before and after each change\n    - Documenting dependencies between the components\n    - Creating a comprehensive test plan that covers both areas simultaneously\n    \n    ## Development Best Practices\n    1. **Gunicorn Restart Management**:\n       - Let Gunicorn handle Flask restarts with the `--reload` flag\n       - Only manually restart Gunicorn when changing its configuration or port\n       - This reduces Windsurf Flow Credits consumption\n    \n    2. **Testing Approaches**:\n       - Browser-based testing is more reliable than curl commands\n       - Curl commands sometimes froze or returned misleading results\n       - When testing APIs, use the browser's developer tools or dedicated API clients\n       - This approach limits Flow Action consumption and provides more accurate results\n    \n    3. **Code Organization**:\n       - Keep route names consistent across the application\n       - Use blueprint prefixes consistently in templates\n       - Maintain proper error handling, especially for AJAX requests\n       - Keep files under 100 lines of code where possible by refactoring into smaller, focused modules\n       - Use helper functions and classes to maintain clean, readable code\n    \n    ## Next Steps\n    1. Verify that the original OAuth admin page is functioning properly\n    2. Test all buttons on both the debug and original OAuth admin pages while ensuring login page functionality remains intact\n    3. Create a comprehensive test plan that covers both OAuth admin and login functionality\n    4. Ensure OAuth provider configuration works end-to-end\n    5. Verify complete login\/logout flow with OAuth providers\n    6. Consider consolidating debug tools into a dedicated health\/monitoring section\n    \n    ## Important Notes\n    - Always refer to the application as \"The Juggler Personal CRM\" (full name)\n    - The application runs on port 5015 with Gunicorn\n    - Debug pages have been valuable for identifying and fixing issues\n    - Changes to either the OAuth admin or login pages must be tested against both components","created_at":"2025-02-27 07:54:25","source":"Reddit (r\/Codeium)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Codeium\/comments\/1iyi866\/any_fellow_nontechnical_windsurfers_here_hows_it\/mf35djh\/","sentiment_label":"Positive","sentiment_score":0.9974,"author":"u\/Czaruno","platform_specific_metrics":"{\"score\": 1, \"num_comments\": 0, \"upvote_ratio\": 0.0, \"is_post\": false}","keywords_found":"[\"windsurf\"]"},{"id":"mf2y17f","text":"Hey, same as you here!

Faster, less error prone and far cheaper than running Claude via Openrouter. \n\nBut the way cline has the memory bank actively in context most of the time, destroys the other two's context and rules. \n\nThe one other agent I'll throw out there is Augment. While it doesn't have rules or memory bank like the others, its indexing and context is absurdly good. And its free claude. Which isn't nothing. \n\nYMMV","created_at":"2025-02-23 02:23:31","source":"Reddit (r\/Codeium)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Codeium\/comments\/1iw0qnq\/i_feel_windsurf_is_underrated_it_deserves_more\/mebk9js\/","sentiment_label":"Positive","sentiment_score":0.7577,"author":"u\/Divest0911","platform_specific_metrics":"{\"score\": 1, \"num_comments\": 0, \"upvote_ratio\": 0.0, \"is_post\": false}","keywords_found":"[\"windsurf\"]"},{"id":"meae157","text":"How does Windsurf compare with Cline using memory-bank?","created_at":"2025-02-22 20:12:31","source":"Reddit (r\/Codeium)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Codeium\/comments\/1iw0qnq\/i_feel_windsurf_is_underrated_it_deserves_more\/meae157\/","sentiment_label":"Neutral","sentiment_score":0.0,"author":"u\/luke23571113","platform_specific_metrics":"{\"score\": 1, \"num_comments\": 0, \"upvote_ratio\": 0.0, \"is_post\": false}","keywords_found":"[\"windsurf\"]"},{"id":"1iw0qnq","text":"I feel Windsurf is underrated. It deserves more recognition\n\nYo, there are a ton of AI agent coding tools out there, and every time they roll out an update, it feels like they completely switch up how they understand projects. \n\nIt\u2019s like they get way more cautious digging deep into duplicate files and even the small-scale stuff. \ud83e\udd14\n\nI\u2019ve tried using various tools on different side projects every time they update, and honestly, some of them really disappoint.\n\nBut gotta give credit where it\u2019s due: even though Windsurf is missing a few features and struggles with some LLM models, when it comes to truly understanding my projects especially compared to something like Claude Sonnet it just nails it.\n\nThis is purely my two cents, coming from someone who\u2019s practically tried every AI agent out there with zero bias.
