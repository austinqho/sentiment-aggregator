1j8qslh,Top 4 AI Coding Tools Offering Specialized Development Support,"For developers seeking tools that go beyond generic AI assistance, here are four platforms which I have tested that offer specialized coding support in no particular order: 

* [BlackBox AI](https://www.blackbox.ai/): Designed specifically for coding, it provides hands-on assistance with smart code completions, full-stack app generation, and automation across diverse projects. 
* [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/): A VS Code-based tool with AI-driven suggestions, ideal for real-time coding support and multi-file edits. 
* [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf): Focuses on intuitive UI and autonomous coding help, with strong context awareness for developers. 
* [Replit](https://replit.com/): Combines an IDE with AI agents, emphasizing execution and collaborative coding environments. 

Have you used or integrated any of these tools into your workflow? 

As a tech enthusiast who’s tested dozens of AI coding platforms, feel free to ask me anything in the comments! :)",2025-03-11 06:31:01,51,10,0.86,webdev,CreepToeCurrentSea,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1j8qslh/top_4_ai_coding_tools_offering_specialized/

Caveat: likely not work for anyone else - Sorry

I had this happen to me today, the write\_file tool worked fine, but the edit\_file tool failed everytime.  
The error is consistent: ""incomplete envelope"" from [192.34.20.166:443](http://192.34.20.166:443)

If I made a new file, no issue, and I could then move it around, but this also BURNED down my flow credits.

They showed up as ReparsePoint in my filesystem:

Solution for me was to not have the files live in a dropbox folder, and move them to a ""simple"" folder.

I got it all moved over the a simple folder, and then it worked fine for me immediately.

Wanted to set up a automated self-hosted Gitlab in WSL, but then I ran out of flow credits and now I am seriously thinking I should just do it manually like a common coder :D

I was to be honest leaning on Windsurf to do things that I could just as easily do myself, so I guess it is fair I lost all of my credits.

1j9pd4b,Windsurf burns through credits by continuously correcting itself,"In this state this hardly more than a fun gimmick. I've tried four different project types now (composing a bash script, setting op a small Spring Boot project, setting up a React/Zustand based web UI and some CUDA code) and in all cases it just loses track once you get beyond even the smallest of setups. As I type this it's in a 20 step flow of fixing a bash script, run it, see a problem, claim it fixed it, run it, same problem, tries variant it already tried. Whatever the combination of memory, attention and model is causing this behavior is unclear to me. I've upgraded a few hours ago and I've burnt through 15% of my total monthly budget. And that's ignoring the fact that it bails on generating edits about 30% of the time with an error (I suspect due to the large size of the scripts it created and them being too large an amount of input tokens for an edit or just service outages, hard to say). Is anyone actually using this for production level codebases? Also, any model other than Claud is doing this thing where it suggests a fix without actually editing the files until you tell it something like ""do it"". 

P.S. It would be an interesting optimization to have some sort of (non LLM/ML based) short term history of generated content so it can avoid burning credits on generating the same command line invocations over and over again.

1jbhgqd,Windsurf Exit Code 130,"Does anyone know how to fix Windsurf exit code 130 error when it is trying to run commands on mac?

It used to work then I stopped using Windsurf for a month and now I need it again and it doesn't run commands anymore. i don't know if i changed something on my mac to cause it.

    $ $ cat /Users/_______/Development/_______/.git/config

Exit Code 130Not auto-runThought Process

I'm getting exit code 130 when trying to run commands, which typically indicates the command was terminated with SIGINT (Ctrl+C). Let me try a simpler approach with less invasive commands to understand the issue.

I notice there's an issue running some of the commands. Let me try a different approach to help diagnose your git remote issue.

Ran terminal command

    ~/Development/________

Go to terminal

    $ pwd

Exit Code 130

I can see the commands are actually running in the terminal when I view it there, just it gets INT x

─    \~/Development/\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_    master ──────────────────────────────────────────────────── INT ✘  07:49:33 PM  ─╮

╰─ git remote -v                                                                                                            ─╯

origin  D:/GitServer/\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.git (fetch)

origin  D:/GitServer/\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.git (push)

So it is able to run the command and display the output of the command in the terminal but then it gets this INT error and everytime Cascade says it got Exit Code 130 instead of doing productive tasks.

1jbz4j3,i figured out how to open a wsl folder from the command line in windsurf,"it's much more esoteric than opening with vscode.

note that just opening a wsl terminal and typing `windsurf .` won't work, at least for me (it opens the folder but doesn't connect to remote).

here's the **powershell command**:

`wsl windsurf --folder-uri ""vscode-remote://wsl+ubuntu/$(wsl wslpath -a 'C:\\your\\folder\\path')""`

# right-click menu

i also use **nilesoft shell** to customize my right-click menu. here's my setup for both windsurf, vscode, and opening in terminal; replace the `image=...` with your own icon paths:

    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir' title='Open in Code' cmd='code' arg=`@sel.path\.` image=image.svgf('C:\icons\vscode.svg'))
    
    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir|file' title='Open in Code (WSL)' cmd='wsl' arg=`code $(wslpath -a '@sel.path')` image=\uE272 window=hidden)
    
    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir' title='Open in Windsurf' cmd='windsurf' arg=`@sel.path\.` image=image('C:\icons\windsurf.png') window=hidden)
    
    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir' title='Open in Windsurf (WSL)' cmd='wsl' arg=`windsurf --folder-uri vscode-remote://wsl+ubuntu$(wslpath -a '@sel.path')` image=image('C:\icons\windsurf.png') window=hidden)
    
    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir' title='Open in Windows Terminal' cmd='wt' arg=`-d ""@sel.path\.""` image=\uE218)
    
    item(mode=""single"" type='dir|back.dir' title='Open in WSL Bash' cmd='wt' arg=`-d ""@sel.path\."" Ubuntu run` directory=sel.path image=\uE0D6)

# edit: 

fixed slight mistake with the windsurf nilesoft shell command, it only supports folders in wsl. also more explanation

# edit2:

if you want to make it connect when you type `wf .` you probably have to write your own script and set it as an alias, something like

    #!/bin/bash
    windsurf --folder-uri vscode-remote://wsl+ubuntu/$1

and then alias it

    echo 'alias wf=""~/bin/windsurf-helper.sh""' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

(bash script and alias are untested)

then you can run it like `wf .`",2025-03-15 09:37:01,0,1,0.5,Codeium,viamiraia,True,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1jbz4j3/i_figured_out_how_to_open_a_wsl_folder_from_the/

Everyone wants a ""hey just let me bring my own API key"" but doesn't realize you're getting \*more\* when you buy through Windsurf or Cursor etc. because a) they literally sell it at or below cost (especially for power users), b) they get real significant volume discounts.

Due to the magic of venture capital Anthropic sells it at a loss, Codeium buys it at a discount and then further subsidizes it. (Or close to). This is why both companies despite being hugely successful are burning venture cash.

So the deal isn't as bad as it seems.

mhmq4bd,,"the balance is definitely off. not to mention all the times it gets enchanted: you used up the prompt, you used up credits in analysis and then the AI ​​doesn't write code... which was exactly the goal for which you used up the previous credits.
I defended Windsurf tooth and nail until yesterday... but I'm having second thoughts... the spark ignited when I saw the post about the context, posted by a developer of the team.
I mean... first of all, who is it that claims that Windsurf's context is the best? I would really like to read the posts of these people, since I have read much more often of people who, having used both Windsurf and Cursor, say that Cursor holds the context better. Second... We are saying here that Windsurf can't call half an instrument successfully, and that the credits are burned... and you tell us that you are working on the context? The context is not the relevant problem at the moment. Getting a giant context will be useless if the tools never work and credits are still being burned, these are the things to take care of, at the top of the list of priorities. The context can always be managed one way or another... But a tool that doesn't work: it just doesn't work.
So I'm starting to wonder if the Codeium team is really a good investment for me...
There are some things I love about their product, the interface, the transparency... (in Cursor you have a harder time understanding how the models work and there is no way to see the consumption, except going to your account in the browser) but Cursor simply works better. The terminal is more responsive. The error rate of Claude 3.5 is close to 0, while with Windsurf, I'm not saying it's not a great model, but it fails a lot more, needs more fixes... which will make you consume more credits...
So whatever the difference under the hood, between Windsurf and Cursor, I guess in Cursor they are currently managing things better. Not to mention the business model... In Cursor there is no flow action, you have your 500 quick prompts and then you continue slowly, with the same model, without worrying about having to buy Flex credits or running out of flow action credits. so I am honestly undecided at this point, whether to renew with Windsurf or pay Cursor. what kept me attached to Windsurf, were basically 3 things: 
1. it was the first agentic IDE I tried, so it is the one I know most deeply. 
2. I see positive and negative comments on any software, so I thought that switching from Windsurf to something else would not solve my problems. 
3. I had problems before, with Cursor, and I thought it was a Cursor problem then I realized that it had nothing to do with it and the problem was with my system, so I was able to try it, I'm trying it right now... in one day I did what I did in two weeks in Windsurf.",2025-03-13 13:39:39,2,0,0.0,Codeium,[deleted],False,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1jai2m5/flow_action_credits_disappear_faster_than_my/mhmq4bd/

1jactfd,Context Retrieval Thread 🧵,"Full X link: https://x.com/_mohansolo/status/1899630153636118529?s=46&t=Y0-MM6SBRJb5opcnoOiuyQ

There’s been a lot of talk recently about how Windsurf’s context retrieval is better than other products. One rebuttal I’ve seen is that all products “index your codebase”.

But indexing code ≠ context retrieval. It is necessary but not sufficient.

Thought I’d share a bit about what we’re doing under the hood to get the best results.

Indexing & embedding search is a tablestakes RAG technique. Btw, even for this technique there are approaches that make this more or less effective. One thing we are doing is AST parsing code and chunking along semantically meaningful boundaries - not random blocks of code. This means that when a code chunk is retrieved, it is a full function or class, not just an arbitrary block of consecutive code.

But embedding search becomes unreliable as a retrieval heuristic as the size of the codebase grows. Instead, we must rely on a combination of techniques like grep/file search, knowledge graph based retrieval, and more. With all these heuristics, a re-ranking step also becomes needed where the retrieved context is ranked in order of relevance. We use LLM based reranking under the hood.

“Varun did you just give away your secret sauce??”

No. This is all known. The reason other products don’t do this is simple: latency. This multidimensional retrieval takes a lot of compute and thus time. The reason Windsurf can do it is because we have spent years investing in building the best GPU infrastructure. After all, we literally started off as a GPU workload optimization company called Exafunction…so we know a thing or two about this 🙂

Hopefully this helps clear the air and explain why those who are testing us side-by-side with other products on small test codebases are getting comparable results. Try us out with a larger repo, and the difference will become clear.",2025-03-13 07:09:08,27,4,0.97,Codeium,Ordinary-Let-4851,True,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1jactfd/context_retrieval_thread/

1j8pivq,Sonnet 3.7 really impressed me for starting a project from scratch,"I shared my experience how I got frustrated from using sonnet 3.7 in my existing project. It costs lots of flow credits but didn't deliver ideal result. But given it is so relentlessly reviewed multiple files back and forth, I got the hope that it can do better at a blank project. So after developing the backend, I gave it a try with my flutter project. 

I tried to make the requirement as details as possible (though not as that detailed as when I was in the corp needing to pass the PRD to engineering team), and then I asked R1 to review the requirements and make a plan based on the requirement. Then I revised the plan a few times trying to reduce ambiguity.  I wasn't that greedy to make everything in the plan because I don't want to overload Sonnet and its buddies so I just got the onboarding module + shared components + core services + data models detailed in the requirement and plan. 

Then Sonnet 3.7 starts its working. It lasted about 30 mins, and more than 50 files were created. I saw it creating the files and then went through files to fix lint errors all over again, speaking of which I really appreciate Windsurf doesn't cost credits when fixing lint errors.

I started the simulator nervously but it successfully started and gave a workable app as I expected. There are still some small issues that I may need to fix later, but so far I was just amazed by what Sonnet 3.7 and Windsurf could do!

The Windsurf team recently shipped an auto-fix-lint-errors thing. I assume this doesn't use the super-premium models, and instead routes to some other service. But they underestimated just how much load / credits / etc. would be taken by the lint-fixing loop.

I think their API load may have > doubled due to the lint fixing feature, and it's a kind of find-the-bottleneck-in-production type of devops issue.

  
This is also coupled with Claude 3.7 being optimized for evals, which favor smaller incremental edits - but this comes at the cost of tokens & usage etc.

So both Claude 3.7 and the auto-fix-lint-errors likely caused larger-than-ancitipated spikes.

So it wants $2 more per month, but considering the unlimited slow requests instead of flow action credits, and the better integrated templates, the tools are called correctly 99% of the time... that $2 more is worth it. So I don't want to just say ""bye bye I'm switching to Cursor"" after criticizing those who do it, but I can say that I'm starting to understand a little more why they do it... I hope to see Windsurf improve and become the tool we're all waiting for, but right now Cursor is just better, whatever the reasons...

1jbv6yw,Is there a way to disable Cascade memories?,"So Cascade Memories seems like a nice idea in theory, however in practice I've begun to find it really troublesome. 

For example, I've recently been working on a few Docker-based Dev Ops projects for deployments of various stacks onto servers and have been using Windsurf to expedite the tedious process of writing multiple Docker Compose files. On the surface, they look like very similar ""things"", but each one is a completely different project with very unique requirements.

One of the stacks (an AI stack) used Langflow. Comically, until it became hugely frustrating, Codeium decided that Langflow should be called ""LandGraph"" and botched the docker-compose and .env by referring to the wrong project. 

I thought that I had finally exorcised ""Landgraph"" from my life but alas, working on a completely different project a week later, Cascade has decided that my current (unrelated) project must be the same thing as I was working on a week ago. Apparently, a memory had been formed along the lines of ""the user uses Landgraph"".

Thus, while executing one of its flows, I noticed that Cascade had taken the executive decision that ""LandGraph"" needed to be added back to this project. Not for the first time, I found myself writing angrily in all caps to a bot: ""THERE IS NO LANDGRAPH. WTH ARE YOU DOING!?!?""

If I can be a little cheeky I suggest again to pay attention to what many users here seem to be saying: there's rough around the edges, but it seems like many of these features just haven't had basic QA-ing.

mgtz1q4,,"I can't help you much because you're working with things I don't know much about, but I understand how Windsurf works quite well, so I can help you on a couple of points: the .md documents are more useful to you than to Cascade. In the sense that you should make it read the documents every time, in every conversation, and if you do it with a premium model you will only consume credits for this. So, here's my example: I have my workspace ""Modulandia"", inside the workspace I have 3 folders: Modulandia, Context, Appunti.
Modulandia is the project folder, it contains the code, the build folder... Context is the folder with the .md files that I prepare for Cascade. Appunti is a folder with .txt files that are exclusively useful to me (for example, a list of commands for the terminal).


How I recommend you use the .md files:
write them, make Cascade Base read them only once and ask it to create a memory. This way you don't have to make him read them later (unless you need to update them... for example if you have Changelog.md and the corresponding saved memory Changelog, update your .md file, delete the saved memory, tell him to read the .md file and create a memory with that information. You can also ask him to just update the memory, but it doesn't always work well and sometimes duplicate memories, so I always prefer to delete the memory and recreate it updated, so having the .md files is useful for you to keep control over the situation, once you have saved Cascade's memories, the .md files become useless for him).


How to mention files for context: mention specific files, for example @Main.cpp, @MainWindow.cpp etc... mentioning the folder doesn't help much, all Cascade will do is look at what files are inside the mentioned folder, then it will have to read those files... So if you mention the files directly, you save time and he saves effort.


Mentioning the folder can be useful when you don't even know where to look for something, situations like: function X should be in one of the files in the @Core folder. then Cascade will look at the files in the folder, try to figure out which file is most likely to contain that functionality, and search until it finds it. but you can do the same thing without mentioning folders and Cascade will simply search the entire workspace.",2025-03-09 03:20:29,3,0,0.0,Codeium,[deleted],False,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j71p0a/how_to_properly_feed_multiple_api_docs_to_cascade/mgtz1q4/

>the .md documents are more useful to you than to Cascade

What do you mean? I've heard that a well-formatted structured markdown is the best format in which to convey a lot of information in an LLM context. There are two alternatives to do this in Windsurf: 1) ask this person via @ web to follow a link and read the api documentation web page, but this doesn't work well, I've tested it many times OR 2) drop chunks of documentation as is directly into the prompt, but this doesn't sound or look right.

>write them, make Cascade Base read them only once and ask it to create a memory

I don't write them myself, I parse them. That's a dozen different API providers and a bunch of method descriptions and code snippets.

For example, if I used R1, then switched to V3, it will also have the thinking process. If I used Sonnet 3.5  or 3.7 then switched to V3. Then it will also keep analyzing files and even take ""find"" action which I rarely see with V3. 

But after a few convos it will act strangely such as repeating the same sentence again and again without making any edit. 

I guess it's a bug that Codeium team will take seriously if it in fact calls Claude API instead of using the in-house V3 model when we are using a V3 model.",2025-03-12 07:49:21,1,2,1.0,Codeium,Personal-Expression3,True,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j9lqbq/v3_model_is_a_chameleon_but_an_inferior_one/
mh20uwv,,"- The file list update doesn't always work properly, I often find the same file duplicated when I have to mention a file in chat, maybe just because I renamed ""main"" to ""Main"" and I see both...
Sometimes just restart Windsurf and I get only the current files...sometimes a full reset is needed (delete the .codeium folder from Appdata, before doing that make sure you have a backup of the rules you set, because you will have to set them again, you will also have to set the Autocomplete and Terminal mode settings again, if you changed them, and of course all the memories you are still interested in, will have to be created again).


- If you don't specify the model you are using, it's hard to tell. Even though the base of Cascade is the engine of all models, each model will affect the behavior of Cascade differently. I guess it's 3.7, I often see the behavior you describe with 3.7. Often it thinks about the code, makes changes, then realizes it could have made them better, then changes again, then realizes it needs to look at more files to better understand the context, then realizes it needs to make more changes... By the time it's done, it's probably eaten 50 credits.


But 90% of the time you'll get the desired result without any compilation errors (or with a couple of small errors that will be fixed immediately).

mhf5r5x,,"Full transparency I work at Cline, but wanted to share my perspective:

Checkpoints are very effective in Cline, especially after our recent 2.0 update, which significantly boosted speed and drastically reduced storage needs.

One key difference is that Cline is usage-based instead of subscription-based (i.e. Cline's not cutting corners on your inference). This means it actively seeks more relevant context from your codebase and engages with you directly, creating a more responsive, agentic experience. However, depending on your usage (especially with 3.7 Sonnet), costs might exceed a fixed monthly subscription like Cursor's $20/month. A solid cost-saving alternative is leveraging high-quality yet more affordable models from DeepSeek or Gemini.

Regarding MCP, Cline has some underrated capabilities here. There's an integrated marketplace allowing you to easily connect to hundreds of servers. Additionally, Cline excels in building MCP servers—I've even created a .clinerules protocol designed specifically to simplify building custom MCP servers (https://docs.cline.bot/mcp-servers/mcp-server-from-scratch).

Overall, there's amazing innovation happening in this space right now. Cursor, Windsurf, and Cline are all bringing unique strengths to the table.

1jb6ncp,Getting tired of switching!,"Looking for a definitive response around stick to cursor, windsurf, etc. or roo-cline.

  
1. Cursor seems to be great, in general, but you never know what you are missing until you try other tools

2. Augment is great, i like how it asks the me on selectively applying code updates, so you are still in control on what changes are being done, and how its making it. Unlike all other tools that use these new diff patterns and auto approve, are more for vibe coding when you don't care and just need the project done (for proof of concepts, pilots, and experimentation type work)

3. Cost wise, roo-cline to be really productive is costing more than cursor actually if you select the good models (and free versions on openrouter suck in terms of network timeouts, plus cline really does not favor any other models except claude)

1j71ou6,Local .md API docs knowledgebase. How to properly feed it to LLM?,"Hey I’m building a web app an API aggregator for a specific topic with a unified simple UI. Something like OpenRouter /chat page, but for a different topic. Different API providers have completely different sets of methods, some use their own Python libraries, others work via HTTP GET/POST. I want to encapsulate each API in a separate library (class?) so my app interacts with all APIs the same way and I can easily integrate new API providers.

To achieve this, I started collecting a directory of markdown API docs for each provider, so the LLM has direct access to the documentation.

1. Is this a good idea overall? Creating a local markdown knowledge base as the way to give LLM access to API docs?

2. How should I structure and store the .md docs to make it easier for the LLM to find what it needs? Is it better to split docs into smaller .md files (\~100 lines / 3,000 chars) OR keep everything in one API Provider = one large .md file (\~700 lines / 20,000 chars) with all methods structured under H1, H2, H3? What works best for LLM?

3. And the main question. How do I properly feed the docs into the context? Should I @ mention a specific file or the entire docs folder in the prompt? Should I add a @ mention for the whole /api-docs folder in rules file? Could MCP help with this somehow?

mgyi37q,,"With gh copilot i just chuck the doc in the context as long as its below ~40k token. The context window is now big enough to do that. Cursor/windsurf you can’t, I think their context window is really small (~30k). 

4o on Copilot is 128k token. Sonnet is similar. So you still have ~50k token to chat and attach file before it start forgetting about the documentation, which is plenty, at least for me

Here how I do it:

I use this: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_reusable-prompt-files-experimental

So you can use a keyboard shortcut to search them and load them in context. I basically copy/paste the documentation in the prompt file. Seems to work fine up to around 40k token. You can check the size of your doc with https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer

If it’s too big, I chunk it in topic.

It actually work much better than Cursor Docs which only get access to a summary of the doc. You can confirm that it’s loaded by asking very specific question to copilot, works like charm for me.

Here a small trick: load the prompt (doc) on the first prompt, then once copilot answer it’s loaded in the context, remove the prompt and then load your files and ask your questions.",2025-03-09 19:17:58,1,0,0.0,ChatGPTCoding,debian3,False,Reddit (r/ChatGPTCoding),https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1j71ou6/local_md_api_docs_knowledgebase_how_to_properly/mgyi37q/
1jbtswp,Which AI tools/models do you use for which tasks?,"There are more AI tools out there than stars in the sky (at least it feels that way 😅). To be honest, I'm starting to lose track:

* Which one for **architecting**?
* Which one for **writing code**?
* Which one for **refactoring & debugging**?
* And do you run any **local models** to leverage your NPU? (Deepseek r1 eg)

I started learning JavaScript four months ago (and I will go on) —lots of **trial and error** and countless ""Why isn't this working?!"" moments. 😅 At the same time, I’ve been closely following AI developments. Every week, a new tool drops, and people claiming to be **the best thing ever**.

So, **what's your approach?** Do you use **ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Windsurf – or do you have hidden gems?** Do you switch tools depending on the task, or do you have a **go-to setup**?
