Whan do you predict will the next Google's AI model and it's successor be released?

mgfhtbv,,"I predict that is will be another massive disappointment like Flash 2.0 and 2.0 EXP.

1206 was way better than the current release 2.0 EXP and 2.0 Flash EXP was better than the current official flash 2.0. I felt they just hyped up releasing a lesser quality model that processes faster.

I used it every single day, since they released the new models I have only tested 2.0 EXP and never used it again.

They keep doing the same thing. So I predict they will do the same in the future.

You can checkout some of these models, they still exist if you use the API. The current SOTA models from GOOGLE are not as good as some of these.

I have closely followed every release they've ever made and have been disappointed so many times.

I will go so far as to say I have been embarrassed recommending some of their products to others I work with.

Design documents I will start with Flash, upload 100 or so images and pdfs (Grok won't let you do that many files)...or if it is a a code base I upload up to 1000 code files (yeah its the limit)...I have specific tuned Gems for different code stacks, architecture, SQL, etc. Then take the output of Flash and then run it through Grok Thinking asking it to expand and give better definition.

Cost: 10 month for Copilot.  24 month Gemini (covers 5 people in my ""family"" group...I have three family members in different phases of college). This also covers One, Youtube (no ads), and Youtube music.

The right answer is""Throttle House"".

ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot and Grok all got it right and gave the right amount of context surrounding the beef between these two channels. The only way any of these other chat bots know the right answer is because this ""beef"" was addressed in other automotive related YouTube videos and podcasts, and these other models have trained on the transcripts frome these videos.

Gemini not only didn't give the right answer, it went on to lecture me about how ""beef"" is probably not the right word or language I should be using when asking the question. I mean, come on!

1j4txae,"Gemini, censorship, communication","Hi! I like Gemini and use it a lot. But it seems to me that he is heavily censored and not good at lively dialog. He refuses to answer many questions or tries to avoid difficult and acute questions. I mean, there should be censorship, but not so strict.

And what about communication? I use this neural network for a variety of reasons. One of them is to communicate or discuss something. And I think he doesn't do communication well enough. His answers are long and very robotic. I'd like to feel like I'm talking to a real person and not an AI that uses too much politeness and flattery.",2025-03-06 04:02:29,0,3,0.42,Bard,Ok_Psychology7527,True,Reddit (r/Bard),https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1j4txae/gemini_censorship_communication/
mgg0m3e,,"Default personality is all same between most models, in fact Gemini has more personality than most. For example R1 is far worse, can't even talk subjects like death rather it keeps claiming it can't understand such nonsense like a light bulb. (It was comparing itself to a light bulb and claiming can a light bulb fear death?)

If you want more personality you gotta write a bot and influence the model as you wish. You can do that in aistudio, using systemprompt section. You can also use frontends like Sillytavern and download other people's bots as character cards to use with Gemini API calls.

There is no limit what kind of bot you can write. Personally i like writing spin-off stories and adding my character for me to play. It becomes like a text RPG with IP worlds, characters, events.

1j33szx,Google AI Introduces PlanGEN: A Multi-Agent AI Framework Designed to Enhance Planning and Reasoning in LLMs through Constraint-Guided Iterative Verification and Adaptive Algorithm Selection,">*Google AI introduces PlanGEN—a multi-agent framework designed to improve planning and reasoning in large language models by incorporating constraint-guided iterative verification and adaptive algorithm selection. PlanGEN comprises three agents that work in concert: the constraint agent extracts problem-specific details, the verification agent evaluates the quality of the proposed plan, and the selection agent chooses the most appropriate inference algorithm based on the problem’s complexity. Rather than relying on a single, rigid approach, this framework facilitates a process in which initial plans are refined iteratively, ensuring that the final output is both accurate and contextually appropriate.*

>*PlanGEN represents a thoughtful advance in addressing the challenges inherent in complex planning and reasoning for large language models. By combining the strengths of multiple specialized agents, the framework supports a more deliberate and iterative approach to generating high-quality plans. Its modular design—centered on the extraction of constraints, iterative verification, and adaptive selection of inference algorithms—ensures that each solution is carefully refined to meet the specific demands of the task at hand.*",2025-03-03 21:34:28,47,5,0.98,Bard,Gaiden206,True,Reddit (r/Bard),https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1j33szx/google_ai_introduces_plangen_a_multiagent_ai/
