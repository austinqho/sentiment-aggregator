1j56ju8,I Built a Footnotes Plugin for Summernote – Looking for Feedback!,"Hey r/webdev,

I recently built and published a **Footnotes plugin** for the **Summernote WYSIWYG editor**, and I’d love to get your thoughts on it! 🎉

🔹 **What It Does:**

* Lets you insert **footnotes** at the cursor position.
* Automatically adds them to the end of the editor’s content.

🔹 **Why I Built It:**  
I noticed that Summernote doesn’t have a built-in footnotes feature, and manually handling footnotes can be frustrating, especially for blogs, academic content, or articles. So, I decided to create a plugin to solve this problem.

🔹 **Check it out here:**  
👉 **GitHub:** [https://github.com/ahmadyousefdev/summernote-footnotes](https://github.com/ahmadyousefdev/summernote-footnotes)

I’d really appreciate any **feedback, feature suggestions, or bug reports**! Let me know if this is something you’d use or if you have ideas for improvement. 🚀

Thanks! 🙌",2025-03-06 13:24:23,1,0,1.0,webdev,floppyzenith,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1j56ju8/i_built_a_footnotes_plugin_for_summernote_looking/
1j6k7f8,I Just Tried Cursor & my Motivation to Learn Programming is Gone,"I've recently landed a position as a junior web developer with React.

mgpr1o1,,"I’ve been programming for more than a decade at this point. Frontend, backend, game, graphics, scientific domains plus some I’m sure I’ve forgotten about. 

Myself, and all of my coworkers who have more than a few years of experience have pretty much the same opinion on AI: it’s just not that good. 

It is faster 99% of the time to just roll up our sleeves and write the code ourselves. 

Does the llm generate code, sometimes even perfectly working code? Of course. This is especially true for very small and well-defined problem spaces. 

Most professional codebases that have been around for even a few months are neither of these things. 

The LLM, even flavors that have the ability to analyze the entire codebase like ides such as cursor can, just cannot hold enough context about the codebase to provide useful results. 

When I was piloting cursor for our company I spent more time reviewing and fixing the code it generated than if I had simply implemented features myself. 

This brings me to my second point: people who are just getting started programming should NOT be using these tools to generate their code. They do not possess the experience to adequately review the generated code.  

This goes double for people who have NO experience programming and think Claude will make them a software engineer. 

I will be blunt: your worry over these language models only highlights your inexperience to me. 

That’s not an insult; it’s not meant to denigrate you. It’s meant to motivate you. Turn off the code complete and keep building things. 

Soon you’ll have enough experience to view these tools as job security because someone will need to come in and rip out all the garbage code being built with these language models.",2025-03-08 09:39:39,14,0,0.0,learnprogramming,Mimikyutwo,False,Reddit (r/learnprogramming),https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j6k7f8/i_just_tried_cursor_my_motivation_to_learn/mgpr1o1/

All that AI can do has been fed into it by humans. All AIs feed/leech code that has been programmed by people way before these AIs existed. The ""AI"" is only accumulating and replicating the combined cognitive effort of tens-thousands of programmers that did these things without it.

If you actually learn and study, you can become better than AI.

mgpcmtt,,"Happy to see a post like this, I've been curious about the landscape for new developers at jobs where ai is encouraged.

>This thing made me feel like I know nothing. It makes all my effort seem worthless it codes faster than me it looks better and it can optimize it's own code.

Does a calculator make you feel inadequate with its math knowledge and effortless computation speed? The answer to both should be yes. But that's fine, your job isn't to memorize and write the best code, your job is to do your job. Instead of an entry level code monkey, you're now a junior architect who is giving instructions to an ai code monkey, congratulations!

My advice is to get good at reading code and giving feedback. You don't want to let ai make any decisions on its own, that's how you get bad or even dangerous results. It might appear to perfectly understand simple problem domains but when it comes to solving business problems it might make an assumption that is the opposite of what you need or includes a fatal miscalculation. A good way to ensure the ai doesn't make too many decisions is to write or request that it writes stubs/signatures only and then put comments in the function body to precisely guide what it will create.

I shill it so much I feel like I should be paid to do so, but I'd also like to mention windsurf. If your company is already set with a dozen licenses or enterprise setup for cursor then so be it, but I enjoyed windsurf as an alternative for an ai integrated ide that can be instructed to code. I don't know what it does better or worse than cursor, but it's good to know what your options are.

Edit: oops, forgot to answer the question. Why learn? If it's your passion to compete with the calculator then keep practicing and you will get better. You need to think deep and ask yourself - what do you actually want? What is more important to you, being able to build a thing without the ai or that the thing gets built?

mgpkwka,,"I believe we’re at an inflection point where the contrast between a CS undergrad’s education and the real work world is going to require an overhaul of that curriculum. I was lucky enough to go to a school that was focused on getting into the industry from a non-programming field. 

I’m here with a Data Science education. Instead of learning machine learning from the fundamentals of sigma algebra (ie most DS programs), we learned:

1. ML/Deep Learning techniques
2. Workflows for efficiently deploying and evaluating models
3. Spark/Distributed ETL on data collected for a Fitbit use case
4. Creating an ML-centric application requiring the use of Jira/Github, deployed to the cloud and pitched to venture capitalists.

And a few others that escape me that directly translated to the job. In a perfect world I would have added CI/CD to the list but that’s it.

All to say that while you do need to know how to program to be a programmer, the experience comes from recognizing solutions and implementing them in a sane way. It also comes from getting good at convincing non-technical people that your technical solutions are profitable. Cursor is making it SO much easier to rapidly prototype ideas and get feedback and figure out what works and doesn’t.

If you want to stay relevant, I’d say the name of the game is to embrace cursor, engage with the code it writes, think critically and challenge the code it generates if it doesn’t seem correct, and ask questions about generated code that you don’t understand. 

I’ve absolutely loved cursor because I can chaotically experiment with ideas, come up with some half baked scripts, and then (here’s where the experience comes in!) come up with a product design plan that addresses requirements and all the common pitfalls that come along with it.

I find it works best for VERY SPECIFIC methods or as a helper, like a code mentor. It's also pretty good at telling you exactly what a piece of code does, if you're inheriting an old code base.

How do you know when the LLM makes mistakes? Well it’s when their generated code fails the tests they themselves made based off project specs. 

I’ve gone through exercises where I will encourage juniors to actually come up with questions about their generated code. If you’re hellbent on them learning, why don’t you turn your “I fill your mind’s cup” into reviewing generated code so that you can discuss the common pitfalls. 

As I’m in AI space, my discussions in code review go both towards “this is what to look for in badly generated code” followed by “what are you prompting and how can we improve that to get the results we do want?” This usually ends up in some great discussions and packages that can be researched and then indexed for the prompt to reference. 

Then it’s my job as architect to assign tickets atomic enough to be easily generated/tweaked and potentially don’t introduce too many dependencies. 

I’m still thoroughly convinced that AI is just exposing our inefficiencies in planning, implementation, mentorship, education, etc… ride the wave or not, but even that “outdated docs” problem has already been solved with knowledge graphs on api/sdk/library documentation.

1ivnr42,I'm a Product Designer who built a Price Comparison platform frontend in 32 hours with Cursor+Claude,"# Introduction

Hey everyone! 👋 I’ve been working on a **comprehensive shopping experienc**e in the form of a **price comparison** platform called [PricePilot](https://trypricepilot.com/)**.**

**It's been designed** to help shoppers discover products efficiently, compare product information side-by-side, and then help compare prices across multiple retailers. As a solo founder, I wanted to share my journey, the challenges I faced, and the tech stack I used.

***BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER:*** *To be transparent as my post is catching the ire of some users, the total time spent on the frontend is at about* ***\~80hrs or so***. The 32 hours I had added in the post title was seeing how fast I could go live with a basic ecommerce frontend which included a search experience, product listings and details page, and full responsiveness.

# Pain Points That Led to PricePilot

Shopping online should be simple, but:

* Finding the best price often means opening multiple tabs and checking different retailers manually.
* Many comparison sites feel outdated, cluttered, or don’t include key product details and features.
* Many platforms prioritize affiliate revenue over a clean UX

I wanted to build something better—**fast, user-friendly, and helpful.**

# How PricePilot Solves These Issues

✅ **Clear, simple UI** and **lightning-fast search** designed for usability  
✅ **Side-by-side product information comparisons** to help you easily compare the differences in price, ratings, and specifications  
✅ **Side-by-side price comparisons** across multiple retailers so you don't have to find the product on each site

*Note: For the moment, we only show US retailers but plan to expand to Canada and perhaps elsewhere once we get everything figured out for the US audience.*

# Tech Stack

💻 **Frontend**: Vercel + Next.js + Typescript + Tailwind CSS + Typesense (Search)  
🛠 **Backend:** Supabase, Python+Playwright+BS4 for web scraping, Node for getting info from APIs and product feeds

# Would Love Your Thoughts!

I’m actively working on improving **search, filtering, and UX optimizations**. Additionally working on getting many more products for you to shop for. If you’re interested in price comparison tools, I’d love your feedback! 🙌

This tool lets you create (from scratch) or tailor your resume (e.g., for a specific job posting) Cursor/ChatGPT-like interface. The resumes it generates follow best practices and are ATS-optimized. 

The whole experience is meant to resemble resume writing consultant – when you first dump your resume into the tool, it already suggests first things that you can do to improve. On the other hand, if you want to tweak it for a particular job position (as in this video), the tool will ask some additional questions to get better understanding of your experience OR just tweak it automatically based on all the info that the tool already has (e.g. from current resume or from past conversations). 

I think this will work great when you want to apply for many different positions while at the same time want to have some personalization for each job you apply to.

1j4prw6,My (Hopeful) Cursor Redemption Arc.,"This past week, I posted on this subreddit about a silly problem that didn’t really need to be fixed—but I’m glad I did. Turns out the custom cursor trail I spent hours fiddling with, which I thought was the coolest thing about my website, actually sucked. And boy, did you guys not hold back. But I’m so glad I got grilled on my terrible cursor—it was distracting and overall just not great.

I decided to channel this energy into creating something new. So, I completely scrapped the old code and started from scratch. I created two new iterations, trying to incorporate as much of everyone's feedback as possible.

From this link, you’ll find three videos: one of my original cursor effect, one that’s a bit Stronger with the Ink, little darker and more rugged, and another that’s watercolor-inspired with some nice light diffusion. It would mean the world to me if, once again, you all were kind enough to lay into me and tell me what sucks. I tried to take in all the feedback I received, and any pointers would also be amazing!

1ix6qqr,Experimenting with an AI-Driven CMS Alternative (v0 + Cursor),"I recently tested a workflow that ditches traditional CMS options for an AI-driven approach. By combining [v0](https://github.com/volta-cli/v0) for deployment and Cursor (an AI code generator) for content creation, I managed to streamline my publishing process without the usual overhead of a large CMS or database.

In my blog post, I explain how I containerized everything, used AI to generate updates, and quickly deployed changes. It’s quite different from WordPress or a typical headless CMS, but I found it flexible and surprisingly straightforward to maintain.

[Here’s the write-up](https://release.com/blog/replace-cms-with-ai-v0-cursor-deployment) if you’d like more details. I’d love any feedback on making this AI-centric approach more robust.

mgkujqk,,"IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate for me. Yes, it's expensive, but this is my profession, not my hobby. I would do DIY work around the house with tools from Walmart or Harbor Freight but if I'm framing, I'm rolling with Metabo (or something equally high quality).

I currently use Copilot because Cursor feels like it tries to replace too much of how I actually USE my IDE in the first place. Not to toot my own horn but hey, I've been coding since I was 14 and I'm 49. Imagine knowing a foreign language for almost 40 years. You may not be the best in the world at it but you've still outgrown tools like Duolingo.

I don't ""chat"" with Copilot and ask it to write a function for me. It's not even about the code it generates. It just honestly takes me longer to write the prompts in the precise way needed to get the function done the way I would have just written it myself. I work mostly on business-oriented Web and mobile apps, and usually when their logic gets complex it's because there are more rules, not because you're trying to come up with a yet-more-optimal ed25519 curve generator. Time sheets can't be submitted if they don't have start and end times. Oh, also, they can't be submitted if the job code is inactive. Oh, and don't forget, end time must be > start time. Oh and a shift can't be >20h without human approval. Oh yeah, check to be sure it's not a holiday. You get the idea. Just listing all that in a chat session as precisely as you need to do to get the code to be correct - I could have just written it in a few minutes. I didn't need help with that.

The reason I use it at all is because of REFACTORING. Man, Copilot is insanely useful when it comes to that. Pivoting some nested object of consts into an array to feed something like a form-fields-defaults dropdown... I'll get some spreadsheet from Product, paste it into a comment, then just start typing the first entry of the array in the shape I want them all to be. By the time I'm on the second or third, it's figured out what I'm doing and I can just code-complete to get the rest. A small amount of editing, and a tedious task is now just a TAB key to accept it and done. And there are no prompts to adjust it either. If I don't like what it's suggesting, I just keep adjusting my first few entries and eventually it figures out the right pattern.",2025-03-07 13:23:06,16,0,0.0,webdev,CodeAndBiscuits,False,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1j5z69o/which_ide_do_you_use/mgkujqk/

\* ChatGPT/Claude/Deepseek web ui - only knows what you tell it

\* Supermaven - like Copilot, but faster I guess

\* cursor - it's pretty much a ChatGPT wrapper in an app. For example, it's asking me questions like \`What framework/technology are you using? (React, Vue, plain HTML, etc.)\` when it has the entire project open and it should be able to know everything about it

\* replit - this is the closest one to the one that I'm looking for, but I couldn't get my project to run in the webview and while I love how it creates new files when appropriate, I would still prefer to have it in my IDE

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)

Put your JS is below the HTML and/or uses a load event to prevent the JS running before the DOM is ready:

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load\_event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event)

Mind you, that using the load event will replace any other JS that defines a load event. You can't have two \`window.onload = (event) => {}\` because the previous one will be replaced.

Also, if you are using an element that isn't a button, it will not display the correct cursor to hint to the viewer that it is clickable. You can specify this in the CSS:

1j0jtey,Took your feedback and made changes to my website!,"Thanks a lot guys for the feedback in the last post ! There were a couple of issues which resonated with the masses and I took them on positive note. Common feedback included :  
1) scrolling being messy  
2) Lack of Nav bar which made it frustrating  
3) too much animation hence unusable  
4) broken subdomains   
5) few buttons being unresponsive   
so I fixed all the above mentioned concerns . Open to more improvement ! Do check out the website again!

Edit 1: 
6)made the light flickering in the nav bar smoother.
7)removed the unnecessary back to home link on one of the pages
8) made the light following cursor affect more robust on the tiles of about page

1ispimw,Help would be appreciate: hitting some roadblocks in building an app,"Hi all!  I wanted to gain some insight from the minds in this sub.  To start out, I wanted to tell you all that I am not a technical mind. I have done any technical work in the past.  My background is 25+ years in sales, biz dev, marketing, CS, etc.  

However, in the last week or so I've attempted to build an app by using Cursor AI and other AI tools.  But I'm beginning to hit a roadblock with connecting databases/the back end to the front end. 

First question: what's the best way for me to learn how to approach these issues?  Which AI tool is best to guide me through these barriers?

Second question: if I am unable to complete this myself, what's the best way to source efficient work for a web app?  this would be a B2B web app in a focused industry primarily targeting sales and customer facing professionals.

## Things to considerate:
1. Both the index.html and store.html links only script.js

2. opening the store.html and refreshing it 2-3 times gives this console error:
```txt
Error: Error fetching data: 
TypeError {}
message: ""Failed to fetch""
stack: ""TypeError: Failed to fetch↵ at window.fetch (http://localhost:8158/mguxb9xw_console.js:8:221620)↵ at fetchData (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:13:28)↵ at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:21:9)↵ at http://localhost:8158/script.js:4:1""
get stack: ƒ ()
set stack: ƒ ()
[[Prototype]]: Object
```
3. Open store.html and adding items in store.html and when I refresh the page 2-3 times it gives this error: and I cant add any items after that
```txt
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
at http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:55:25
at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
at renderCartItems (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:47:16)
at setupShoppingCart (http://localhost:8158/shoppingCart.js:22:3)
```
4. Clearing the localStorage and trying does not solve any problem

5. I threw both my code and errors at AI tools for help, but instead of fixing the bug, we both ended up more confused—now it feels like the AI is debugging me!

1j6d84j,Best AI for Programming (2025-03),"Hey all, I've been using free-tier AI tools pretty intensively over the past few months to support my work and daily life. About 70% of my usage is for programming, and the rest is for other stuff. I’ve been jumping between tools like ChatGPT, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Deepseek—mostly because one of them is usually down or hits its limit when I need it.

Recently, I discovered Lovable dev (along with similar options like Bolt and v0) and gave it a try—pretty impressive stuff 😅. Now I'm feeling a bit stuck on which one is really worth upgrading to a paid subscription.

Any thoughts or suggestions? Also, if anyone’s got a setup that mixes two or more free AIs or even self-hosting options (whether on your own hardware or a rented server), I'm all ears.

For context, I'm a fullstack developer. Thanks in advance!",2025-03-08 00:59:40,0,2,0.22,webdev,matchalixious,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1j6d84j/best_ai_for_programming_202503/
1iomxgs,AI that can 'see' the website you're browsing,"Is there an AI tool (extension etc.) that can see the webpage you have open in your browser and then write code based on that?

I don't mean an AI assistant inside an IDE, but let's say you're making an extension for reddit; so you'd browse to [reddit.com](http://reddit.com) and tell the AI tool to write you JS mutation observer function that hides all the comments below a certain threshold. Just an example.

  
Copilot in Edge can't see the page apparently.

If that's not currently possible, how about you give it an url and it visits the page to ""look"" at it. Or do I have to copy the website's source and paste it into Cursor or something?",2025-02-13 08:26:30,0,4,0.11,webdev,vikernes,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1iomxgs/ai_that_can_see_the_website_youre_browsing/

1ini225,AI Usage in IDE's,"I'm sure this has been beaten to death, but let's give it another go.

I use several IDE's and one thing they all share is a thriving AI ecosystem. From JetBrains to VSCode the drive to AI is hard to ignore. That  VSCode-->Copilot-->GitHub workflow is really something and keeps getting better.

Codeium, Cursor and such only make it easier and as open source models emerge and costs come down it's only going to get more common.

Being able to say, ""Using DDEV, create a directory, make a database and clone this repo into it then run the install script "" and have it all work is freakin' magic. Telling my editor to make a change, say to rename something, throughout my entire codebase is trivial and I can say it in plain English. Most of the time it's just fancy find&replace, but it's almost always better formatted and commented than I would do alone. I don't even have to mess with Prettier and linters.

I can feed this thing specific docs. I'm not a smart man, there are many docs that I find impenetrable and many more that I constantly Google. Relating those docs to the codebase that I'm working in purely amazing -- I can find out anything. Right where I actually need it.

Sure, sometimes it goes horribly wrong, but this is why it's in IDE's to start with. A baseline knowledge is assumed -- .cursorrules and context are not trivial if you want them to work. Prompt engineering isn't hard, just describe what you want, but it also isn't idiot proof and if you don't understand the code and can't use the editor without AI you are done. Over. Rover.

So yeah, I'm all in on AI and was wondering how others felt.",2025-02-11 19:48:02,0,4,0.23,webdev,fultonchain,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ini225/ai_usage_in_ides/

1itinty,Loading screen question,"I got a working loading that is almost to my personal favorite. I just need to change the cursor color to gold. And the ring colors around. But I was wondering what should I do about the amount of times it shows up.

I currently have it so that it loads every time a user goes to the homepage. It's great. And I want to add a purposeful delay. Like make the screen 3 seconds long for the whole thing to work. And since the ring is already pulsing, make the text under it do the same.

But I was wondering if I should only have it once when someone goes into the website for the first time or should I just keep it so ita will always show up whenever a user goes to the homepage from any tab in my website?

Addition: I am just making a portfolio/personal website. I'm making this becuase there a few elements in the script takes maybe a second or two. I am adjusting the loading to be quick. And I have a fading animation for when the loading is done.

I do want to add in something in the beginning. But It would be horrible to make someone click an extra step every  time they want to go home.",2025-02-19 14:30:24,1,2,1.0,webdev,mobilefreak_lee,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1itinty/loading_screen_question/
1j0bvk2,AI Code Assistant Demos,"I think tools like Cursor and Copilot are nice. They haven’t been useful or reliable enough to revolutionize my workflow, but they certainly keep me from bouncing around Stack Overflow.

I just find the messaging around these tools to be a little bizarre. There is almost a late night infomercial vibe to it all. 

“Throw all your knives away! You only need this one!”

I saw a post by someone who works at a VP level raving over a demo where someone cloned an app using some AI tool. He then trash talked the “old school” way of building software with scrum teams and dozens of devs.

It was very disappointing, and alarming to see a post like that, because I feel he should know better. Imagine working as a welder, and your boss walks in and says, “I saw a commercial where this guy put an entire boat together using this stuff called Flex Seal. All he had to do was spray it on. I want all this old school welding equipment out of here.”

I wish the messaging around these tools would change. Because they are good tools, and they deserve better than “For only $19.99, you can build an app in minutes!”

1ird6g1,Experiencing Algorithms Skill Issues and Not Sure How To Get Good,"Please let me know if there is a diff subreddit I should post this in!

First things first: I am in my first intro to algos class and after looking at my grades... I am doomed. I am fundamentally missing something and cannot figure out for the life of me why I am so pathetically bad at this.

For one, I have like a decent amount of experience programming; I've done a handful of beginner projects, and generally feel like I can explain fundamental concepts (abstraction/classes/etc) decently enough, but when I go to code this intense sense of dread and stupidity washes over me and I feel immense pain, frustration, and self hatred every time I do it.

Now, in this course, this sense of frustration and impatience has just officially hit its peak. I am missing pretty much every deadline because I procrastinate so much, and when I do hit the deadlines, I either don't recurse enough times in something or I am using dynamic arrays when they want me to use static arrays, etc. and I am just losing it. While I understand procrastination does not help, there is nothing I would rather avoid than doing a CS project while in the midst of my other more interesting EE-focused classes, and I also just like. Hate it.

One great example is this palindrome detector I'm trying to build. I know in and out how this problem should go, the whole vector of vectors structure I want to use, what my recursive functions are going to do, what their base cases should be, what helper functions I need, what edge cases I want to check for, and yet here I sit, gazing on my VSCode terminal with a completely blank .cpp file and my cursor blinking at me menacingly. Like everything is there in my head but actually putting it down I have so many things I need to start I don't even know where to begin.

In the past, I've tried writing pseudocode, and that helps a little, but I always end up with a pile of awful horrible bugs that make me feel incredibly discouraged, and I've tried starting with smaller functions, but I always find myself going back and forth from unit tests and getting so caught up in writing test cases that the actual code part itself is the last thing I want to do when I've adequately created 1-2 working functions.

It also hurts that in lecture, etc a lot of these concepts download pretty quickly and feel digestible. I really like conceptually concocting solutions to problems and feel comfortable explaining and figuring out where specific data structures are most optimal. Not a single \*written\* assignment has been difficult for me, it is literally just programming.

Now that I'm done whining, here come the questions: how do I overcome this skill issue? Is there a particular resource that will help me build my programming muscle, and if so, is that what is fundamentally missing here? I've heard LeetCode is pretty good, but nobody I talk to can really speak to its value as they haven't really needed it (they just good like that I guess). I'm considering trying it out because in other problem-solving/design-oriented classes, I largely benefit from doing a massive volume of practice problems, but if there is a resource that is better, I would love some insight. Additionally, how do I avoid the testing trap where I find myself just focusing on writing test cases and neglect the actual progress I'm trying to make?

I am still safe to pass if I make a drastic enough change and really refocus my energy, but I need to get on that ASAP if I want to actually do decently well in the course. Any and all advice will be cherished and valued immensely.",2025-02-16 22:04:49,16,8,0.88,learnprogramming,janky-squirrel98,True,Reddit (r/learnprogramming),https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ird6g1/experiencing_algorithms_skill_issues_and_not_sure/

Are you maybe overcomplicating it?

I don't think you need all this stuff for palindrome detection, do you? (Unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean by that...)

I suggest trying the simplest thing first.",2025-02-17 05:13:06,3,0,0.0,learnprogramming,throwaway6560192,False,Reddit (r/learnprogramming),https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ird6g1/experiencing_algorithms_skill_issues_and_not_sure/md8qjo9/
1j7c5qa,Software engineer who is bad at planning,"I’m a software engineer who is bad at planning. 

Ways in which this affects me:
- Writing design docs bores me. I would rather prototype and learn as I do. Though I do see benefit of designing to ensure requirements are clear, evaluate trade-offs, and prevent wasted efforts / inefficient solutions. I see the benefit. I just don’t enjoy writing them as much. I like to do. 
- It’s difficult for me to estimate the ETA of a task. I’d rather just work on two important tasks in parallel and try to finish both as quickly as possible. When I am blocked on one, I work on the other. 
- And I’m worried that Cursor/Copilot AI is going to automate me, and I don’t really have any career plan here when that happens. 


Can anyone relate? Does anyone have any advice?

Currently I just try to work with good planners and shower them with a lot of appreciation (though let’s be real, good planners are already highly rewarded in every workplace and industry).

I'm supposed to make a game in windows forms and I chose a top down shooter. I created a script to rotate a weapon around the player depending on where the mouse cursor is but now I need to rotate the weapon around itself so it always faces the curser.

1ikrf38,Want to Build things Combining Code with No-Code,"Hey,

 i want to build things like Custom AI Solutions for Customers or a AI SaaS (not here to grab quick cash, just really like it).
I started learning Basics of Python (Brilliant.org Course) which taught me in some way the way to think to Code. I then started doing Automations as Projects using No Code / Low Code Platforms like [v0.dev](http://v0.dev), [Make.com](http://Make.com), Airtable and Cursor AI which i have gotten quite good at using and building sufficient Automations, because i can understand really basic code and what is trying to do. But, as you might have guessed, No Code really has its limitations and i am willing to learn.   

Maybe you guys have good ideas what Languages to learn (I was thinking about React or Node.Js or Something) to use and combine No Code Solutions to get the most leverage out of my work.  

And good ressources to do so. I am willing to pay for resources as long as they are efficient. I dont like Reading all the time, but i also dont like just watching a video, i like interactive/intuitiv explanations (Like [Brilliant.org](http://Brilliant.org) but with the Languages i want to learn)

I understand arrows have special functionality in terminals, to go back to the previous entry, etc.

1ize0ag,Best free alternative of Cursor in VSC with local setup with LM Studio,"Hi,

I would like your opinion on which tool to use to replace Cursor. I like how Cursor works, but I don't want to pay to access all the available features. I have a PC on which I run LM Studio with a Deepseek or Qwen model and I would like to use this instead of the online models via API, so I don't pay for the use because I run it locally. 

I would like to use VSC with some plugin that can connect to my machine with LM Studio and that can replicate the same functions as Cursor. For the functions I would like to have both the suggestions and the autocompletion, but above all the Composer (that function that allows me to create things from scratch starting from a description given in the chat).

Basically, I would like all the Cursor functions, only through free plugins in VSC. Is this possible?

1imxyz2,Internal debate on using AI while coding,"This is not a question as much as its a prompt to hear how others have experienced the transition between coding #raw into coding with an assistant, such as Cursor IDE or Github Copilot

I am 1 year 3 months into working in industry as a frontend engineer, coding mostly with Tanstack/React.

I told myself I needed to work 1 year full time before downloading an AI assistant to give myself a solid foundation. As mentioned, that period was up 3 months ago, when I downloaded Cursor and have been using it since. (A flawed idea? probably)

I have undeniably realized some pretty noticeable productivity gains in development, both in code quality and speed. That said, I can feeeeel myself becoming an idiot. Things I would usually have had to dig into have become a prompt and accept with quick review. Not to mention, I can design an entire system using a concept that I only kind of understand, if I was to switch to a normal editor or try to explain it to a coworker, I will not be able to do it at nearly the depth that maybe I should? It feels wrong but the question remains in my mind as this. 

Do I:

**A) Revert to not using AI, slowly progressing at the risk of not leveraging the 2025 toolset that is increasingly geared towards AI, but really understand what tf I am doing.**

  
or

  
**B) Trust that AI code assistants are not going anywhere and lean into using it becoming a faster and more immediately effective.**   
  
Every once in a while I will get stuck on a problem, furiously prompting, like an addict just begging my computer to spit out the correct answer, which ultimately is such a less gratifying experience than struggling through it on my own. 

I know the answer to this question is ""depends on your goals"" or ""usage within reason is the answer"". 

But in general: @ people who have been coding with AI for longer than 3 months - do you consider yourself a more capable engineer? Are you often caught up with below surface level problems? Have you reverted back to a normal IDE and found many of the skills transfer, or is it really you now cannot code at nearly the same level without the assistant?

1j43hka,What are the best alternatives to Cursor?,"Since the latest update Cursor has become unusable. The model ignores rules. It forgets instructions after the first couple edits. It refuses to read files when instructed and will even lie claiming it carefully read and checked something it didn't. It will make edits that are completely non-sensical in context. It will make edits you didn't ask for. edit: I should add that this is not limited to 3.7. It's worse on 3.7 but it happens on 3.5 as well. Something definitely changed that's causing these problems.

I'm guessing this all probably stems from Cursor aggressively cutting down context in an attempt to save costs. I doubt the $20/mo price point is enough to cover the model costs if providing the context the user actually wants to provide. It seems like Cursor is attempting to summarize or cut down context to a bare minimum which leads to all the problems listed above.

Given that Cursor simply doesn't work in its current form, what are the best alternatives? Pros and cons? Experiences with other tools?

As the process chain of the agent increased, any errors in one step would result in bad codes. This may last a long time because any work beyond the model is just the glue, which is the same for all the AI editors.

At some point, the end user would feel ""Hmmm. This is not really a Big Mac anymore, is it?""

1j3v1zi,I built a Cursor extension that actually REMEMBERS your codebase (because I'm tired of Cursor breaking my codebase every damn time),"Hey fellow devs,

After weeks of wanting to break my computer when Cursor kept breaking my code, I finally snapped and built something.

**The frustration we all know:**

* Explaining your project structure over and over and OVER again
* AI forgetting which libraries you're using after 3 messages
* Getting suggestions that completely ignore your architecture
* That sinking feeling when you realize the ""helpful"" AI just created 47 new bugs

**What I built:** A Cursor extension that creates and maintains a ""project brain"" - it's like giving AI a permanent memory of your codebase's context, architecture, and dev rules.

It works by:

* Creating a detailed spec file of your project's architecture decisions
* Maintaining awareness of file relationships and dependencies
* Actually understanding your tech stack choices (not just guessing)
* Auto-updating as your codebase evolves

**Early users report:**

* AI suggestions that actually make sense for their projects
* No more repeatedly explaining project structure
* Massive reduction in ""AI broke my code"" incidents

Drop a comment or DM if interested! And tell me - what's your biggest frustration with current AI coding tools?",2025-03-04 20:37:07,213,214,0.74,cursor,namanyayg,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j3v1zi/i_built_a_cursor_extension_that_actually/

mg3zkjy,,"This is like creating md files, with specific instructions  
For Example,  
You create [ProjectStructure.md](http://ProjectStructure.md) , [Objectives.md](http://Objectives.md), [Guidelines.md](http://Guidelines.md), [Coding.md](http://Coding.md), [Frontend.md](http://Frontend.md), [backend.md](http://backend.md), [check.md](http://check.md)

You will mainly use [check.md](http://check.md)  
in there  
""ALWAYS"" means -> checking each content of every md file in detail without missing out any content

then say   
Always check  [ProjectStructure.md](http://ProjectStructure.md) , before creating any new file, and also update it before implementing the last file during composing.

Always use [Frontend.md](http://Frontend.md), if you are creating and detected editing a front end file.

Always use, check, and update [Objectives.md](http://Objectives.md) once implementing current and the next steps.  
........  
and this goes on ...............  
  
the good thing about this, is that you could create your own custom instructions based on the project, once you already used this once in the project, although it might not work at first, but you could improve it based on your own requirements  
  
for example, i had [Error.md](http://Error.md) file, i told cursor to always add linter errors, or any other errors that i paste for it solve in the  [Error.md](http://Error.md) file and how it solved it, it did not automatically add until i had to mention about it, or you could even write a run a script, for this.

I think memory is already there, its just based on instructions to add to train in more based on a user's requirement, because other's do not even need rules because of the way the do the prompting, which is very important, the way you word it makes a big difference, not just normal English.

Maybe you could create an Extension to install in Cursor about logging and learning from this Errors, like whatever the project you could use that log  
for example it would usually   
\-sometimes install uncompatible dependencies.  
\-keep { } in import statements that do not need.  
\-Typescript coding style errors,

So you could accumulate this, tell cursor to always check this log before implementing files, so that it could learn, I am sure this will reduce the struggles. 

Maybe another once would implementation style  
For example  
\-It implements modules that have not been installed yet, whereby it should first install all necessary modules then implement the files  
  
\-sometimes it suggests to use a library but that library does not support certain implementation style or variable, which causes alot of errors, whereby it should first check the requirement of your project, then check a library to is flexible supports our implementation requirements. 

Although some might argue that they still create completed projects without any of the above, but it would still better for a user to have there personal memory that there own cursor could use during implementations.  
  
  
Maybe there might be someone has created, but i dont think if its 100% functional meaning that cursor always uses and follows it during the implementations, i think some it might be there but cursor does not fetch it sometimes, and just goes based on its own LLM implementations, And we cant force it follow the memory but use, learn then implement, which should be done.",2025-03-04 23:12:41,4,0,0.0,cursor,[deleted],False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j3v1zi/i_built_a_cursor_extension_that_actually/mg3zkjy/

*What you are describing is not exactly correct. You are referring to a tool that creates a better prompt for Cursor which ultimately can lead to better outcome. I think that could be interesting / useful. But when you say that the tool understands the entire code base that infers that somehow all the code is encapsulated into the model context, which, although doable for smaller projects, will be terribly inefficient.*

1iz2kdb,Claude 3.7 is worse than 3.5 in Cursor RN,"Unpopular opinion


It’s way too eager, constantly trying to do stuff in the code even when you don’t ask it to. 
It straight-up ignores serious linter errors and always over-engineers everything. 
It also ignores rules - like if you say DRY, KISS, and YAGNI, it still keeps overthinking. 
It hyper-focuses on some problem, overanalyzes it, and immediately tries to “fix” it. And that sucks.

* **UI Glow Up:** Our new unified chat interface includes several design improvements to de-clutter the UI and improve your flow. Three new themes designed for the Cursor UI are now available. To select a theme, go to Settings > Theme > Color Theme in the Cursor menu.
* **Agent Web Access:** Agent now proactively searches the web to find information when needed without having to include \`@web\` in your prompts.
* **Secure .cursorignore:** New security rules ensure that files listed in .cursorignore are never shared with LLMs or seen by Cursor. The new .cursorindexignore file supports the previous ignore functionality that only limits files from indexing.
* **Agent Tool Limit:** When reaching the 25 tool call limit, the Agent now displays a button to continue beyond this limit with a single click. Bypassing the limit consumes an extra request.
* **New MCP Features:** MCP gains new features like Yolo mode, the ability to configure Project Servers with .cursor/mcp.json, and the ability for Agent to use MCP resources as context.
* **Improved Project Rules:** A visual indicator is now shown anytime a rules set is applied to a request, and rules can now be applied globally.
* **Claude 3.7 Sonnet:** Support for our newest Premium models from Anthropic, Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking - both enabled for Agent.

**Fixes**

* **Crash Fixes:** Several memory, performance and reliability improvements.
* **MCP Fixes**: Reliability and quality of life fixes to make building MCP servers in Cursor even better.
* **Windows Fixes**: 
   * Fixed newline error in Chat Codeblocks

Used .46 all yesterday and it felt extremely laggy - just the UI in general.  Activity monitor using 3.5GB+ memory and just typing and submitting prompts would take seconds and then when an action happened moving the mouse cursor over action of scrolling etc felt really laggy too.\\

Just opened it now and without doing anything the Renderer task will hit 40% CPU without even doing anything, just clicking in it.. scrolling a file much more.

It didn't seem to be the AI aspect of Cursor, but rather the base Renderer task using a lot of resources and acting very slow.

At first it was really impressive, the autocomplete seamlessly integrates with our previous habits, but so much smarter.

Then you start using the chat, and the composer, more and more. First to solve small issues or parts of a library you don't understand. As you get used to it you delegate more and more of your work to the Composer and your work consists of designing how you want your project to work and leave almost all the code to the composer. And it sucks. As soon as you reach several files, different dependancies, libraries more or less unknown to the model it becomes so bad. Your life consists of waiting for it to spur shit code, ask to fix, wait, ask to fix, wait, get stuck, debug by hand, rince and repeat. 

It becomes extremely frustrating, you feel like you become dumber, the assistant actually loses your time instead of saving it.

mcqh1oa,,"As your codebase grows larger, it helps to change the way you guide the model. If you continue to interact with it as you did when working on simple tasks or tiny codebases, you may have disappointing results.

I find that for more complex codebases, it really helps to have an indexed requirements directory with files that you can reference when talking with the model. These can be higher-level specs that explain the different sections of the codebase, Mermaid diagrams that visualize flows/states/relationships, and requirements docs for specific aspects of the code. I continue to add these requirements docs when I find the model needs more guidance. For example, if the model is inconsistent with the way it implements a feature in different parts of the code, I'll ask it to create a requirements doc with rules for the feature. Then, any time it's updating code related to the feature, I'll reference the doc and ask that it ensures all updates comply with the doc's rules.

You should also build up rules for the model in ""Rules for AI"" (used on all Cursor projects) and ""Project Rules"" (used for a specific project and can be targeted to specific directories or files). I find the best way to write these rules is incrementally as you find the model getting confused or making mistakes.

Comments in the code can also help the model better understand how each file relates to the codebase as a whole.

Hopefully, these tips can give you some ideas on how to mitigate the challenges that come with AI-assisted programming on larger codebases.

mcs792e,,"Adding to the chorus: I think you’re approaching it from the wrong angle. I keep my cursor on a tight leash. It’s basically just a really beefy autocomplete plus a sort of macro engine (c preprocessor style, or like excel’s drag-to-continue-the-pattern). I only let it do actual structural work in three cases: 

1. A blank file. It’s quite competent at figuring out what boilerplate to spit out. 
2. CSS and HTML (when in the same context or same file). It’s quite good at designing new elements with their corresponding css. It’s better than me at from-scratch css; I’m better at refinement. 
3. OpenGL code. It has a quite good understanding of openGL and can produce solutions that would take me 15-30 mins of research to get, plus possibly trial and error and a lot of googling.

Stop raging on OP like ""skill issue"".

I want to say: I feel you OP, been there a lot.

Indeed, most comments mention useful tactics / workarounds.

At the end of the day I think understanding the code matters the most.  
We're not yet at a stage where you can blindly trust the AI and let it do its thing.  
You have to verify the code written by the AI, thoroughly test it, and go small increment by small increment.

So it's a great productivity tool (lets you do faster what you already know how to do), but I wouldn't use it to substitute for what I don't know, from my experience this gets you lost pretty fast and ends up being counterproductive.

We shouldn't forget we are at the forefront of this revolution, messing around with these tools and pushing them to their max. The models will improve, and us early adopters we will be extremely proficient with Cursor et al. when the models are optimal. So like every new piece of tech, let's confidently go through the learning curve.

\- Sure, there are a lot of unreasonable expectations and silly complaints to dunk on.

\- Cursor does replace you \*for some tasks\*. Not all tasks, but some. I needed to write a bit of R code recently to separate out some highly parallel computations from a sequential process that needed to process those results in a specific order. Cursor effectively replaced me \*for the task of writing the solution to that problem\*.

\- Using cursor effectively means knowing where the line is between what cursor is more efficient at vs. what you are more efficient at.

\- People understandably get frustrated when that line is very hard to identify, is highly variable across domains.

\- People also seem to be under the impression that this line actually moves in subtle ways for the exact same model, which if true makes things way more frustrating.

\- Hard to say to what extent the above is true, but it isn't at all implausible that service providers are varying the amount of test time compute that is allowed depending on load or other factors and that this bleeds into the quality of cursor's coding.",2025-02-14 07:27:27,26,0,0.0,cursor,jrdnmdhl,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1ipcejv/cursor_is_so_dumb_no_youre_the_problem/mcqricg/

And then I see what people in this subreddit do. A dozen **rules**, elaborate **prompts**, **MCP servers, folder structures** \- while not even being able to work on one single project consistently and complaining about their experience here.

Meanwhile, I am also paying 4000-5000+ fast requests per month, for the convenience for this to be even faster. And its an ROI, as the projects I work on are production level apps that have users/clients. It also just keeps getting progressively better, month after month.

mctdbv4,,"????

What the fuck are you people even talking about right now. 3 months ago i could ask cursor to copy the code of X component and then do Z component based on that. it would work fine, furthermore, i could then do changes to Z component and tell it to based on that fix some other thing, it had no problem.

now it struggles to imitate X on Z and when i do changes to Z and tell it to based on those changes add something else, it goes back to its own version of Z disregarding the changes i just made.

this is clear degradation in the quality of the responses. it's not some ""projects grow"" bullshit because it happens with all projects, like I said, it happens on new and small projects as well as in big and complex projects.

you can twist it around as much as you like, the only truth is that cursor right now is much worse than it was 3 months ago.

the reason why the quality of the responses went down, is that the team at cursor constantly push updates that mess with the composer degrading the quality of the responses, i don't know if they do it unconciously or if they do it to cut costs, but it's obvious that the quality of the responses went down, i've been using cursor for 6+ months, it's not hard to notice that the quality is going down, specially because every week we get new quirks and shit we have to play around.

2 weeks ago it was slow responses taking 5+ minutes, now it's cursor being incapable of adapting to code changes which is maddening tbh. how is it possible that it ignores changes you do to your code?

to give you a clear example, i have a button, classname=""p-3 m-2"" i tell cursor to increase the margin, it outputs classname=""p-3 m-4"", fine, then i decide 4 was too much so i lower it to 3. i then ask it to do something else and it corrects the margin back to 4 even though i just gave it the new code that had the m-3. this was not an issue a few weeks ago, now it happens all the time. even if i literally tell it that i adapted their code and that it shoudl reanalize it, it still disregards what i'm passing to it and pulls code from before.

so essentially it's refusing to read new code thinking that it is the same, this is basic LLM lazyness and it happens when you reduce the amount of tokens.

# ""Cursor is so dumb"" - No, you're the problem

  
your take is very stupid, if you're telling the LLM to not do something, and it does it all the same, even though months ago it worked fine, then the issue is not the user, it's the quality of the response that has truly degraded.",2025-02-14 15:16:05,-1,0,0.0,cursor,TheNasky1,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1ipcejv/cursor_is_so_dumb_no_youre_the_problem/mctdbv4/

Not stellar, but I could definitely get lift out of it. Used the right way for the right things I was fine with it. Claude 3.7 comes out and seems great in and of itself. The original cursor usage seemed great and improvement from that previous way of using in cursor. I could go farther with less oversight. But then wham... constant confusion... over doing it... getting lost all the time... recommending / doing like 15 things in one composer request that were way beyond the well specified scope. Quickly crossed the line of more work than reward. I could set the llm back to 3.5 but I'm sure you see how bad that feels. A new and improved llm to leverage... that we can't.

It sounds like it uses 3.7 a lot better. I'm trying it out. If it's better it's better. I'm sure others will be picking up and trying out that option as well.

Type of work I do:  
traditional ml pipelines. Data -> feature construction -> fitting -> forecasting. some automl. Cursor is / was great. but there's enough fine grained detail / continuity of composer conversations needed to keep the momentum in implementing the current thing. the tradeoff is usually smaller thing per conversation = less oversight / chance of success. over the last 6 months composer has improved tremendously and that grew to medium thing with some oversight to be productive. but then this last week it's back to small thing with tight management and even then it runs away with itself.

mewhlnh,,"I worry about how many (more) bad and terrible apps and software is going to be out in the world over the next few years from people blindly just sticking it together till it works (kinda).  The amount of exploitable, bad performing, buggy and non maintainable software that makes no sense will be huge imo.  AI and cursor is great at helping you get up to speed, digging through APIs (when it doesn’t just make stuff up), writing flowcharts or docs, but if you don’t know what it’s writing or basic design you’re in trouble and it will do way more damage to you and your ability to learn.  
Think of it like this,
You’re trying to learn Spanish , so you get a translator and a tutor, now you don’t know Spanish, heck you don’t even know the syntax or grammar rules but you have to trust your translator is telling you correctly.  So if you ask it to translate The Dog and it returns “gato el” you probably think ok cool, not realizing that “Cat the” isn’t what you wanted, it might still work depending on what you’re trying to do but it definitely isn’t right.

If you’re trying to learn a language or how to program then stay off Agent mode or composer and only ask an AI if your stuck or what something means.  The auto complete can screw you if you don’t understand the basics and compose and agent will give you over complicated maddening results that you don’t have the basic understanding to decipher.

That said, I usually find that the second you start working on a problem that doesn’t have a commonly known solution, even if you describe your solution in detail to the point that any intern could pick up the task, there’s a pretty decent chance you’ll get a bad response.

In particular, when a codebase gets large enough (spread across multiple entry point apps and libs), I’ve found cursor starts to hallucinate dependencies, types, enum members, etc. Yes, even when I include the specific files to be used as dependencies. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great at what it does, but a single hallucinated dependency can easily ruin an entire set of output and clarifying further usually does not help.

I find it especially bad for making small specific changes, as just manually coding the solution with the help of cursor tab is WAY faster than writing up a plain-English description.

I’ve personally found my best workflow to be:
- Use composer for new files that need boilerplate while providing copious examples of similar files
- Use agent mode for writing tests
- Use chat mode like a rubber duck that knows how to code
- Use cursor tab + manual coding for everything else (it catches on VERY quickly)

Today i spent 5 hours using cursor 41.2 and did the same, this time I had more control and the implementation was not only 12 times more efficient (huge improvement to an already optimized system), but also worked fine and i didn't have to discard anything.

i think cursor .46 is good if you want to do something quick and small, the AI does everything and is pretty good at it too, but if you're building something big and complex i feel the agent mode just sucks, it first does things you don't ask for and second does too much at a time making it hard to keep track of things, additionally the new UI is shit imo, no more back/forward arrows, no more search bar for commands, 2 big features of vscode, removed for no reason.

mfxplt1,,"I mean that’s plain wrong.

Building an optimized web app isn’t that hard with cursor. You just gotta look at the complexity of that app. There is stuff that will be hard for someone clueless in cursor when it gets too complicated but some basic stuff using APIs and existing libraries? No problem.

But at the end I also have the feeling, the knowledge that you say someone “needs” can kinda be replaced with more grind in many instances. Also those arguments always read like they expect the non developer to be entirely stupid… you can still find out correct approaches to achieve your goals without knowing them at the beginning of the project.. just be honest with yourself and research the things you don’t know… with AI that’s as easy as never before…

The knowledgeable web dev will be way quicker achieving his stuff in cursor because he won’t do all kinds of stupid prompts.

But I would disagree in the notion that it’s impossible to also achieve it without actually being a dev… Just gotta box you out of the endless loops of errors when you don’t understand the issues (or just try again with a different prompt (or just ask for potential solutions and then go over to fix stuff)

I’m a designer foremost and have very barebones web devs skills and building a full blown iOS app with multiple functions works like a charm…

Will my code be the best? No. Will I achieve it as quickly as someone with knowledge? No.

Am I be capable of reaching my goals? I would argue yes…

To switch the tables here, I could equally argue that UI and UX cursor applies to the projects isn’t actually on par with following a real Design process and that Devs creating apps with cursor will still build trashy or ugly standard apps because they don’t know how to actually build nice and understandable user flows and stuff like that. What is the superior code worth with a trashy concept?

But here again, I personally believe the dev can achieve good levels with putting enough effort in himself… will it be as quick  to reach the goal or quality wise on paar with a designer doing it? Probably not, but it’s achievable to do great things still…

Building software around existing APis and libraries really isn’t that hard with cursor right now as a noob as long you’re willing to suffer a bit and have a not entirely stupid approach to the project.

mftxfxs,,"Thing is 1 you don’t know what you don’t know. There is a prompting advantage to those who know stuff. Even if it’s just what questions to ask. And if you start with little knowledge and learn what to ask over time you are actually learning programming. Maybe not the syntax of programming, but like the guy who wrote all the programming books Tim oreilly wrote in his blog recently, we’ve just hit a place where the next higher level programming language has become English. I’ve been at this long enough (ai coding) to confidently say nothing just magically appeared without a lot of thoughtful prompting and the English is basically the same as the logic of normal programming without needing to bother with the syntax of a language. 

As a developer it’s actually pretty freeing to vibe code in languages I don’t even understand myself for the most part. The field of programming is large enough that even if you are an expert in one area of it you can’t be in all areas of it. The fundamentals help you leap to other areas and draw parallels like do this thing I would have done in the language I know but in the language I don’t.

2. I know stuff and I’m still spending all my time prompting. Things get done much faster but the stuff I’m attempting to build alone now would have taken a team of 4 before over a period of months. I don’t doubt that the number of developers needed will decrease to create the same output over time, but as has always been in the case in the past the market just demands more. And maybe some day AI will be able to do the whole thing without developers, but right now I’m just trying to make more alone and that has me working all the time. Not sure how long it’s going to be before you don’t actually need any developers any more, but right now it still takes a lot of time with AI to build a full product and someone needs to do it as a job. And from a practical perspective there are real productivity advantages to someone trained in development using these tools over someone who isn’t and can only 100% vibe code. 

What is left to be seen though is what happens when you pit the 100% vibe coders against the developer luddites who refuse to use these new tools, of which there are many. I did a poll a little while back and it was something like 1/3+ developers refused to use ai tools because they were adamant they suck and they preferred the control of doing it all themselves. I think we might see the vibe coders beating experienced Luddite developers with experience at some point as the AI will just be so much faster than manual typing.

I wouldn’t poo poo the power of experienced developers who have also gone all in on these tools though. You don’t know what you don’t know and knowing stuff allows you to connect knowledge to capability instantly with ai. Can’t tell you the number of times I’m watching the agent code and I’m like “why are you doing this? Wouldn’t it make more sense to do this instead?” It course corrects and I save it from junking up the project with another thing it’s going to get confused about later. Which is sort of the other pole of this conversation, the people criticizing the output quality of LLMs. If you can read the code and understand the logic it’s not hard to notice when it leaves a clean pattern and to tell it to fix it and write a rule stopping it from doing it again.

By the time the industry truly doesn’t need developers to make stuff anymore ai agents are going to replace so many other jobs too. Yeah developers are scared to be replaced but everybody should be. The elite don’t have any plan for how the masses are going to make a living once the ai companies achieve their goal of replacing all labor with AI and machines. That’s the scariest part to me.

The scope is largely to achieve the baseline quality that even a very mediocre engineer will bring to the table.

When I look at all kinds of low/no code platforms to build websites and stuff like that for non devs, they are essentially already replaceable.

With AI non devs can suddenly create software. And while the framing here sounds like they would be inferior to the devs I disagree hard.

AI enables all kinds of people from different professional backgrounds to create software and make the ability to code secondary. Those people  surely are worse at coding, but they are way better than most devs at their very own topic.

Medical influenced people could build software concepts from scratch in their field that no dev would ever think of without the needed insight and that no company would ever build due to limited income potential.

It puts the app/software concept at the forefront imo.

Many nooby people had ideas for apps in their lives. Most never did it because of the development skill missing and being gatekeeped to not even try. That barrier is breaking down right now.

The future of coding with AI  will put good ideas on the forefront. Not good coding.

I’m pretty sure there are tons of apps and software to build around existing apis and libraries that haven’t been build yet.

mfu83i7,,"Yeah I think where we are disagreeing is you don’t think what you are doing is development because you aren’t writing a programming language to make your software. 

Given I don’t know what you are building I can assume though that you are giving instructions in English that when translated into code by AI are actually closer to code than you might realize. English has become the new higher level programming language. This is conceptually similar to when higher level languages like JavaScript or Python were created to simplify programming and got compiled down into assembly or c++. 

I’m sure there were people at the time who thought coding like that wasn’t real coding because real coding was writing straight assembly. But almost all coding became using higher level languages because it saved so much time.

Development at its core is the progress of starting with some requirements and working with the computer until it can do those requirements. That’s still what you are doing and still takes considerable time even with ai. It’s still a job and not every non developer would want to sit in front of the computer wrestling with the AI for hours until the goal was achieved. Regardless of how you get there if you are the one struggling in front of the machine until it’s done you are being a developer. 

I don’t think I would change my definition of this until you can make a fully functional app as fast as you can make a song with Suno ai for example. With a three sentence prompt you can make a professional 3 minute track. I’d be hard pressed to call that composing and would agree with you that it’s just prompting. Working with cursor is nothing like that. It’s hundreds of prompts to get even close to something that does anything. My original point though circling back wasn’t really to gate keep you from learning and building but more so pointing out how hard it still is and that people with experience developing still have a leg up and are still valuable using these tools. But rather than gatekeep and separate you to also point out that if you are spending significant time prompting you too are a developer now. And without you your idea would not get built.

1j1kemq,"Cursor is a Game-Changer, But You Still Need the Basics","I’ve been in software engineering for over 20 years and hold a PhD in ML. I love Cursor—it’s an incredible tool that can 10x productivity, especially when working within a known language or framework.

For my daily work, I primarily use Python, and most of the time, I know 90% of what needs to be done (the rest I look up along the way). In these cases, Cursor is amazing. It speeds up development, helps with boilerplate code, and fills in gaps efficiently.

However, I’ve also tested Cursor on technologies I wasn’t familiar with. I built a web app in Next.js despite having only worked with Angular before. While I eventually completed the project, it took a lot of iterations and requests. Then, I tried building an iOS app with SwiftUI. This time, I burned through countless requests, got stuck, and ultimately couldn’t finish it. At some point, it felt like I might succeed, but I realized I was just patching things together without fully understanding how they worked.

This experience taught me a key lesson: AI can help tremendously, but it’s not a shortcut to deep understanding. Trying to build a production-ready app without grasping the framework’s core concepts leads to frustration and wasted time. Now, I’ve decided to properly learn SwiftUI before attempting another project.

My advice? Before diving into a new stack, take time to understand its fundamentals—basic building blocks, core patterns, and underlying concepts. In the end, this approach is faster than bouncing from one dead end to another.",2025-03-01 22:18:11,253,51,0.98,cursor,ThickDoctor007,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j1kemq/cursor_is_a_gamechanger_but_you_still_need_the/

mci4gu0,,"I have one for you, my man.

I’m non-technical, and this is how I use Cursor:

* **ChatGPT** – I use it for all documentation, prompting, and general product advice. With a clear project description, I actually prefer GPT-4o over all other advanced modules because it’s straightforward and gives me exactly what I need.
* **Notion** – I use it for *all* documentation. I keep everything related to the project—concept overview, customer pain points, tech stack, etc.—on a single page. You *can* organize it under toggle headers for better visuals, but it doesn’t really matter. The *main* reason I use Notion is that ChatGPT can access it. That’s why I keep everything on one big page rather than spreading it across multiple pages—it ensures ChatGPT always has a complete, holistic view of the app.
* **Cursor** – I use it for actual development. Since I usually define the development scope with ChatGPT first, mistakes are minimal. Also, I *almost never* use more than one message in a single Composer session. I have ChatGPT define the prompt so well (including code examples, environment variables, etc.) that it becomes a piece of cake for Composer to execute. I’d say I spend around 60% of my time in ChatGPT defining what needs to be built and learning new things (auth, APIs, whatever), 25% updating Notion (since it has to stay up to date), and only 15% in Cursor actually coding.

I know my approach is kind of like wearing two condoms—super safe. But I’ve tried *raw* prompting in Replit, v0, and even Composer, and all I got were constant headaches and bugs I couldn’t fix as a non-developer.

So, the *MCP* I’d love to have? A constant connection to a knowledge base like Notion. If I could set a project rule that forces Composer to *always* check the documentation before starting *any* development and cross-reference it with the codebase and our goals, I think it would reduce mistakes by 90%.",2025-02-12 21:10:07,1,0,0.0,cursor,anaem1c,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1inw2lt/cursor_interacting_with_chrome_dev_tools/mci4gu0/

1iuvain,I've tested the new Cursor 0.46 - UI Update,"  
Hi,

full thread+updates here: 

[https://x.com/kregenrek/status/1892884736059613652](https://x.com/kregenrek/status/1892884736059613652)

**UI Update:**

Cursor 0.46 is here and we got some fresh UI Updates.  
  
Chat -> Ask  
Composer (normal) -> Edit  
Composer (agent) -> Agent  
  
You can switch between modes with ⌘+.

https://preview.redd.it/gie3c6fcsike1.png?width=2239&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b3a60c5e78102347fb47f6a5392a327c5ea44fd

**You can reference the terminal:**

https://reddit.com/link/1iuvain/video/e0iihjnwsike1/player

**Git Reference:**

Cursor 0.46 explains you what happened in a specific Git Commit.

https://reddit.com/link/1iuvain/video/lbfq3ajasike1/player

**No window switch anymore**

You can now switch between modes within the same context.  
  
For example, you can ask something and then start the agent based on that or vice versa. This eliminates the need to transfer context between windows.

https://preview.redd.it/vjxabfr6sike1.png?width=2389&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ffa998f3294b4451cc5ce22faf94ad070a39350

  
TBH this is still confusing. I liked the old version better where don't had two buttons with the same highlighting style. It's like having a ""Ok"" and ""Confirm"" button. It also seems to be a bit buggy. If you apply and reapply files a few times, you don't get any changes.  
  
Save all -> Accept All  
Apply -> Apply all

**Cursorrules:**  
  
\- Global rules can now be set with the globe icon.  
\- Instead of ""globs"" its called Auto Attach (But its still called globs in the YAML Frontmatter Header).  
\- In the frontmatter you have now a new Option for the Global usage.

Applied rules are visible in the Chat

1isci4s,I gave up on using Cursor and here's why,"I mean, I'm not here to say that Cursor is not useful, I'm here to tell my own story as an indie dev.  
After a while and after the first excitement gasped away, I realised that there's a reason why coding is mind ""flow"" and concentration, you have to concentrate on what you're doing and doing it well, you have to remember what you did and why you did it, even after weeks.  
I ended up ""autopiloting"" my flow, I was not thinking at what I was doing. After few days I did not remember why some things were done like that, I did not remember what I've did simply because I was not focused while I was coding, I was just keep on pushing ""tab"" and thinking about something else and losing focus. I guess this could be the ""golden egg"" for employed devs because you simply squeeze your mind less and deliver the daily s\*\*t but I think this is not good on the long run, both for the dev and for the company.

I was just ""abusing"", it was too easy to code. Devs must know how to code and must focus on what they're doing to learn and improve. First I tought that a junior dev would have done the job of a senior and a newbie would have done the job of a junior, but now I don't think so anymore. You have to be accountable on the stuff I write and I can't just blame the AI when my code has flows or doesn't work.  
My new habit is the old one: asking chatGPT something and use it after critical review now it's fine for me but autopiloting my code I guess it's not good because I was too much temped to let the AI do my job and it was too easy to get carried away.",2025-02-18 05:20:24,106,71,0.85,cursor,Consistent_Sally_11,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1isci4s/i_gave_up_on_using_cursor_and_heres_why/

mdfd947,,"Don't let the AI stop you being an engineer. I've been coding today, had AI assisting me - to be honest, it was spectacularly useless today, but I'm letting it read the codebase and using it in Ask mode only today (using roocode, not cursor)

My code is still way too convoluted and complicated to let an AI touch it really, but I am refactoring the code slowly and introducing unit tests and integration tests everywhere. Having the AI write unit tests for me is really fantastic - as a solo dev, I really was lazy before and never bothered, but AI makes adding unit tests a lot easier and you can then go tweak those unit tests to be more comprehensive.

I've definitely found that if you don't give the AI context, it can really mess with your shit. Like today, I'd asked it about how it would approach a problem, so then I said ok go - add that solution to this file. What did it do? It replaced the entire 2000 line file with its own 50 lines of code...

Obviously I use git, so I reverted and then implemented the edits myself, but really this was my fault as the AI had very little context about this particular piece of code I was editing.

So - I'm heading towards having comprehensive unit tests, but that's not enough on its own (who's to say the AI won't just change your unit test so that the broken code passes? It has happened to me before!)

The extra stuff the AI really needs is an architectural overview of the work and a current-state-of-play. I found this really comprehensive article yesterday that I think we all should read:

tldr? AI is a tool, use it as such and do not abandon your software engineering principles. In fact, use it to strengthen them and make your code more robust.

edit: another approach I've been using is to give the AI permission to create a new 'migration' folder and for it to create sample code and tests within that folder along with a migration script for how it thinks these edits should be applied to the main code base. I've got a job like that to do this afternoon, to work through the list the AI made for me and it got a bunch of it spectacularly wrong, but copying over these bits and pieces manually makes me have full knowledge about what's going on in my own code base so this approach might suit you. The AIs are good at writing .md files, so give that a go. And figure out 'ask' mode instead of 'code' mode.

mdgi46h,,"The best analogy for me is pair programming. In pair programming, there are two roles, driver and navigator. The driver writes the code, while the navigator provides direction, oversight and corrections. I did intense pair programming while working for a project at pivotal labs. When I started using cursor/cline, etc I treated AI like the driver, and I'm the navigator, but full time. What's important is understanding the role of the navigator. You aren't a neutral observer. Your role is to closely watch the driver, think about corrections, provide feedback, etc. If the driver can't explain what they are doing, you need to stop and ask. When the driver starts to veer off course, you need to help provide direction. As the navigator you need to ensure that the principles, like DRY, KISS, YAGNI, etc are all maintained. I also highly recommend doing TDD. This ensures that even if it produces code you don't quite understand, you have confidence that it's implemented correctly as the tests can act as like a proof of  it working according to intended behaviour.

mea3atj,,"I don't fully agree with your viewpoint, but I understand and respect your decision.

Perhaps because you're so familiar with technical details, you don't feel the need for AI assistance. Everyone is at different levels and stages, so their requirements for AI will vary accordingly.

For me, AI programming, especially Cursor, is incredibly useful! It brings back that initial feeling of learning to program - that sensation of solving problems with simple thinking. Programming should serve to complete tasks, and if there's a simple way to achieve it, it shouldn't be complicated. When I first learned VB or C, I felt programming was truly enjoyable. Simple tasks could be completed easily, and even complex tasks felt manageable by combining a series of simple methods.

But what has programming become in recent years? New frameworks appear almost every month, each with its own set of complex rules. Now, even implementing the simplest task has become very complicated. For example, adding a browser control to a window - in VB, you could just drag and drop the control, and a few lines of code would complete many tasks. After switching to the .NET platform, this same task became extremely complex. I've done this type of design several times, but I still can't remember how to do it and need to refer to my notes.

Now AI handles all these complex details for you, eliminating the complexity of these frameworks. It allows people to have an easier time. However, AI applications might gradually become more complex themselves - this seems to be a general rule of how things work, and might be unavoidable.

1inn0oy,Use cursor for what its meant for,"Cursor was never designed not intended for people with zero coding knowledge to write apps

I've seen some discussions where people ask if **CursorAI** is a good tool for beginners or even non-programmers, and I think it's important to clarify what it actually does and who it’s for.

At its core, **CursorAI is an AI-powered IDE** built to **enhance a programmer's workflow**, not replace programming knowledge. It’s designed for people who already understand **how to code** and want to speed up development, reduce boilerplate, and get AI-powered assistance in their coding environment. Here's why non-programmers will likely struggle with it:

# 1. You Still Need to Understand Code

CursorAI is **not a no-code or low-code tool**. It doesn't magically build applications for you. It assists **by suggesting code completions, refactoring existing code, debugging, and answering technical questions**—but if you don’t already know how to write and read code, these suggestions won’t make sense.

For example, if you ask Cursor to ""generate a React component,"" it will spit out React code, but **you still need to understand what that code does, how to modify it, and how to integrate it into a larger project**. If you have zero programming knowledge, you'll be stuck wondering what to do with the output.

# 2. AI Assistance ≠ Learning to Code

While CursorAI can help clarify concepts and answer programming questions, it **doesn't replace learning how to program**. A beginner would still be better off learning programming fundamentals through structured resources like freeCodeCamp, CS50, or other beginner courses.

A tool like ChatGPT or DeepSeek might help explain concepts, but **without a foundation in programming, you won’t be able to verify if AI-generated code is correct, efficient, or secure.** AI can hallucinate, make mistakes, and produce inefficient solutions—things that require real programming experience to catch.

# 3. Debugging Requires Knowledge, Not Just AI Assistance

One of CursorAI’s best features is **inline debugging** and error-fixing suggestions. But if you don’t understand programming, **you won’t know why a bug exists, why the AI’s suggestion works (or doesn’t), or what deeper issues might be lurking.**

AI-generated fixes are great, but **blindly applying them without understanding** is a recipe for disaster, especially for complex systems. If a beginner pastes AI-generated code into a project without understanding it, they could introduce bugs that they can’t debug themselves.

# 4. It’s an AI-Powered Productivity Booster for Devs

The main **value proposition of CursorAI** is improving developer productivity. It helps devs **write code faster, debug more efficiently, and generate code snippets for common tasks.**

But it’s not a magic “make an app” button—it won’t teach you:

* How to structure a project
* How different programming languages work
* How to think like a programmer
* How to make architectural decisions

# 5. Non-Programmers Will Be Lost Without Context

A complete beginner using CursorAI would **have no frame of reference** for its suggestions. Even if it generates a full function, **what then?** What file should it go in? How do you test it? What dependencies does it require? Without prior programming experience, these are huge blockers.",2025-02-12 01:14:21,89,71,0.87,cursor,chunkypenguion1991,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1inn0oy/use_cursor_for_what_its_meant_for/

Well, with the new Agent mode, it will put it in the right file, it will generate tests for it, it will even run the tests if you tell it to. And it can use the CLI to install any needed dependencies.

Having said that, if the project is too complex, there WILL be a point where something happens that neither the non-coder nor the LLMs will be able to fix. At that point, programming knowledge will be needed, and usually more than what you can get from a quick bootcamp.

For non-coders, I'd highly recommend using Cursor to make some simple scripts or apps for personal use, or even stuff like a website for their small business (though don't do this if you need a payment system or anything that would go really bad if it went wrong)

mebsnj9,,"Couldn’t have said it better. Every AI has a free tier and you can just manually copy and paste from the web or desktop interface to vs code. Cursors paid plan (excluding their custom auto complete model) is you just prepaying a quota of calls for paid AI. The free program AI will still give you the same answers just less per day. 

I also don’t know if cursor is trying to market to an audience outside of the US at that price point (where they would see the price is an obvious issue). Cursor is considered incredibly cheap in the US at 0.5% of the monthly median US wage and they are still one of the fastest growing startups of all time in user base, revenue, and investor funding. 

Cline is a vs code extension that is essentially cursor composer but you just need to plug in the api key. If you have an api key from someone like deepseek, you can just put that in cline and have 90% of the cursor experience. You just have to pay for what you use. 

The issue with AI is the compute requirements in a capitalist world ensure it can’t be given away so we are in a weird spot where the competition isn’t favorable for anyone not in the US yet. Google seems to be the only player who can afford to “give away” high tier gemini compute because they are the only enterprise player and can afford to do so. The others are beholden to their investors and the tight competition that is more important for the small research startups to win at because they don’t have 20 years of business they can fall back on like Google.

1ikq9m6,Cursor IDE: Setup and Workflow in Larger Projects,"I want to share my development setup and workflow. I have more than 10+ years of development experience and recently switched to coding only in Cursor IDE. I spend about 6 hours every weekday coding in it, plus some extra time on weekends. Let me show you how I've set this up.

## Writing Code Through Tests First

Initially, I wrote code directly in Cursor. While this worked for small repos, it became risky in larger projects - AI-generated code could easily break existing functionality. Being overly careful defeated Cursor's primary benefit: rapid implementation with review during PR.

My colleague Dmitry suggested test-driven development. While I tried full TDD, writing many tests before implementation, while reliable, was too time-consuming. Especially when refactoring interfaces, as I had to rewrite all test cases.

I found a sweet spot with 1-2 integration tests using real credentials. Write one failing test, implement the feature, and get a checkpoint. Add more tests only after the interface stabilizes. When working on feature #16, a quick test run confirms I haven't broken features #1-15.

This creates an efficient AI feedback loop. The test lets AI write code, check results, and fix issues automatically. It's faster than manual verification while keeping the code reliable, even when Cursor rewrites multiple files.

## Breaking Tasks Into Small Steps

Finding the right task size is the most crucial skill I've developed while working with Cursor. The test-first approach works especially well when you write a test for each small, well-defined piece of work. But what's ""small enough""?

It is too big, and the Cursor might go off track, requiring you to roll back everything. Too small, and you'll spend more time writing tests than solving the actual problem. This sweet spot between too big and too small is the most complex skill to explain, but it's what I've been learning the most.

That's why the same task might seem impossible for one developer using Cursor but completely doable for another - even when coding purely by voice. An experienced Cursor user knows how to break down features into the right-sized steps and cover them with tests in a way that builds up the complete feature with minimal human intervention.

## Preserving Thought Process as Documentation

I used to rely heavily on chat history with the AI. Starting a new chat felt risky - I might lose important context or solutions, especially when breaking down an oversized task into smaller pieces. Explaining everything again in a new chat was time-consuming.

Now, I save all our discussions and decisions in design documents and commit to the code. Before PR, I often refine these documents into cleaner documentation, removing some of the intermediate thinking. But by committing even the intermediate files, my colleagues can see my thought process, decision points, and reasoning if they're interested. I can also track the history of these changes.

Documenting our dialogue, overall goals, task breakdowns, and their statuses has made working with Cursor much smoother. I can freely start a new chat, add my design doc for context, and continue from any point. Chat session length no longer worries me.

## Working Exclusively Through Composer Agent

I started with just the chat interface - it supported more models and seemed to give better control over code changes. I was convinced that Composer Agent was just a simplified tool for junior developers learning Cursor IDE. As an experienced developer, I dismissed it as too basic for my needs.

My colleague Daniel kept suggesting I try switching completely to Composer Agent. At first, I maintained my stance - I was too ""advanced"" for such tools. But the ability to roll back to any point in our dialogue, modify the prompt, automatically restore files to that state, and try again turned out to be incredibly powerful. The integrated terminal commands and automatic result viewing made everything faster.

I started using Agent mode occasionally, then more frequently. For the past month, I haven't opened chat or normal Composer mode once - I work exclusively in Composer Agent. I highly recommend trying it, even if you're a seasoned developer. It takes some getting used to, but you maintain full code control, and the benefits are worth it.

## Voice Dictation to Chat Text

I know this part won't resonate with everyone. Many of my developer friends are excellent typists who hate voice interfaces or work in offices where speaking isn't practical. But I've always enjoyed voice interfaces despite being a developer. For me, it just feels natural.

I often work from home, and now I do all my programming in Cursor IDE with 99% of my input through voice using SuperWhisper. For me, it's a perfect setup that works incredibly well. But I understand this approach isn't universal - some developers are much more comfortable expressing themselves through text, and that's perfectly fine.

mboq6km,,"> 1. can you expand on where in your flow you implement the tests? how does this work when working through a feature with cursor?

The test implementation has been woven into my feature development since day one. I start by planning the feature and breaking it into manageable steps, documenting everything in a design doc that serves as our roadmap. This document captures both the overall vision and the detailed steps we'll take to get there.

The cursor and I then collaborated on the testing approach. For each step in the design document, we created a focused integration test that served as a checkpoint for that particular piece of functionality. Most features naturally break into 5-6 steps, giving us a clear set of tests to work with.

The implementation flow is where the magic happens. For each step, I write a test to verify that specific piece, run it to see it fail (classic TDD red stage), and create basic stubs without the actual logic. Then Cursor takes the spotlight - I ask it to implement the code to make our test pass and watch as it works through the solution. The process is quite elegant.

By the end, we have a solid suite of 5-6 tests covering the entire feature, each corresponding to one of our planned steps. It's methodical but feels natural once you get into its rhythm.

> 2. have you implemented any of these best practices through cursor rules that help facilitate them?

Yes, I've implemented these practices across different levels of Cursor configuration - in the IDE-wide settings, in project-level `.cursorrules` files, and sometimes even in `.cursor/rules/*` patterns.

Instead, I test each feature with real integration tests using actual credentials, but usually just one or two tests per feature. When we break down a large task into steps, I don't do full TDD coverage for each step while building the feature. It's more about creating a feedback loop for Cursor to work with than actual TDD.

Fun fact - I'm dictating this answer through SuperWhisper to my Cursor IDE right now! I installed it with basic settings, switched to a different model from the default one, and enabled auto-mute during dictation. I speak naturally into the Composer Agent window, and Cursor's AI polishes my casual speech into proper text, which I can then copy straight to Reddit or anywhere else.

Don't worry about perfect pronunciation or exact file names - Cursor is smart enough to understand what you mean. Just install SuperWhisper, try it with minimal configuration, and let Cursor's LLM clean up the rest. That's literally all there is to it.

One small caveat - very rarely, SuperWhisper might fail to process your voice message into text. It's particularly frustrating when this happens after dictating for a couple of minutes. Fortunately, you can find the audio recording in SuperWhisper's history and retry the conversion. While this workaround helps, I hope the developers will fix these rare hiccups soon, as they can be quite annoying when they occur.",2025-02-11 10:57:10,2,0,0.0,cursor,Kirmark,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1ikq9m6/cursor_ide_setup_and_workflow_in_larger_projects/mc8an6l/

Sometimes, when Cursor doesn't catch the right files, I'll go back and manually add the `@` references. But surprisingly often, Cursor understands which files I mean even with imperfect pronunciation.

mgd8e50,," ~~.env files are on the .cursorignore list by default~~. Tab could have picked up this sensitive value per the following:

* sensitive value was in another indexed file that was not listed in the ignore files
* OP typed value into file when working with tab, deleted it, and then Tab suggested it

OP, curious if any of these applied to your scenario? In the meantime, I've passed this to an engineer to validate and he's looking into it now. Thanks for the report!

As for the person saying that everything’s already been made. Idk if that’s trolling or serious, but that’s a very closed minded way of thinking and nothing would ever be accomplished if everyone thought like that. 

It’s true that people probably have 90 percent of the apps they’ll ever use already on their phone but there’s still room for new apps so long as they’re useful. If your plan is to create a to-do list, or an AI powered calorie tracking app you’re probably not going to have much luck because I see a new one almost every day.

1. This is a lot to keep track of, I'm lost, 'I'm not sure where I am' 
   1. This can be because you had to go off on a tangent to fix a little bug, or, because the task you're trying to do is so big, you've just lost track.
2. I wish I'd documented what I asked for, so I can learn next time how to do this better
3. It's lost, it's forgotten all the little details I told it and now  it's guessing

We have a solution, and it's simple.

In Agent Mode, type out what you want it to do, or better still, type it in a text editor and copy and paste in, you can use new lines simpler.

Check in the [Todo.md](http://Todo.md) file to git.   
Now it's checked it, you'll clearly see exactly where it's got too, and any changes made to it, as it goes.

Last step...

>""implement that tasks in [TODO.md](http://TODO.md), be sure to tick them off as you complete them.""

And off it goes.

Is it 100% bulletproof perfect? no, it still made some mistakes. But it really helps you keep track of progress, and fix things faster too.

Also, it did just keep going, and going, and going, FANTASTIC.

  
For context, I created a whole translation app for all the translation.json files for [https://pricepergig.com/](https://pricepergig.com/) in less than 2 hours after getting it exactly the way I wanted.

>Do not make formatting changes to code (altering whitespace, switching single quotes for double quote, modifying tabing, etc) unless those changes are absolutly essential for the work on this task.  The reason we want to avoid making unnecessary formatting changes is because they add a lot of clutter and confusion to the git diff logs.

Then my process is as follows.  I get cursor to work on an issue and once I have tested it and it works (which often involves a back-and-forth as Cursor experiments) I then tell Cursor that I'm going to revert the files back to their original state and that I want Cursor to first describe exactly how to make the changes required for the task in the most surgical manner, after which I will revert the files and then Cursor can proceed to re-implement based on everything it learned.

1j56j7i,Found a workaround for Cursor context limit,"I found a really good workaround for this problem everyone has been having, but it takes about an hour of setup.

1. Set up a Google Gemini API key (free)
2. Set up `cursor-tools` (you can find this on GitHub)
3. Follow the installation steps and integrate it into your project (the cursorrules file is important)
4. Every time you give big instructions, at the bottom of the prompt tell Agent to ""ask Gemini to help you plan, and when you are finished, ask it to review your work""
5. `cursor-tools` zips the *entire* repo, uploads it to Gemini (which has a 2 million context token window), and it comes back with very clever analysis and a smart feedback loop for Agent. They kind of start talking to each other which is really cool to watch.

This workflow is generating really good results. I guess a lot of the intelligence problems really are down to the context summarisation.

The other thing I found works well is to ignore the new ""Start a new chat for better results"" message. Starting a new chat seems to lower the IQ of Cursor a lot, so I am sticking to the same chat for a day or two until a feature/project is completed.

Edit: I would recommend only attempting this if you are an experienced developer, because I've had to solve numerous configuration issues over the last 24 hours to get to 100% perfection, and even now it could break at any moment. But it is pretty incredible. My Cursor (v0.46.10) is one shotting very complex tasks again with Claude 3.7 Thinking + Gemini Pro.

Notes:

- 0.5.0, the version you can just npm install right now, only seems to work up to 1 million tokens
- 0.6.0-alpha.7 supports OpenRouter and [you can force it to use the 2 million token model](https://github.com/eastlondoner/cursor-tools/issues/57)
- But the alpha version randomly crashes about 1 in 10 times. You will waste fast requests restoring checkpoint and restarting it, if you care about that.
- Auto setup seems to automatically create the .cursorrules file but it doesn't work all the time, you should create the [.mdc](https://github.com/eastlondoner/cursor-tools/blob/2fbb1dfd5760c4712b98489bd133095225432827/.cursor/rules/cursor-tools.mdc) file instead.
- If you have a complex shell setup with zsh, zshell, nvm etc, cursor-tools might not be available inside the Agent's shell. You will have to debug this yourself.

I would go with the 0.5.0 version and the AI Studio key, not the 0.6.0-alpha.7 OpenRouter way, unless you have a huge repo or like getting hurt on the bleeding edge",2025-03-06 13:23:41,119,42,1.0,cursor,nfrmn,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j56j7i/found_a_workaround_for_cursor_context_limit/

1iojub2,How I solved Cursor's hallucination problems with Supabase using 2 MCP Protocols,"Hey r/cursor!

I wanted to share some interesting findings from my recent experiments with Cursor AI and Supabase integration. Like many of you, I've been frustrated with Cursor occasionally hallucinating when generating React components, especially when dealing with complex database schemas.

I've been working on a solution using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that has dramatically improved the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated code. The key breakthrough came from creating a dedicated MCP server that acts as a ""truth source"" for Supabase schema information.

What's different about this approach:

* Instead of relying on Cursor to interpret database structures from code snippets, the MCP server provides real-time, accurate schema information
* The server understands complex relationships, RLS policies, and type constraints, preventing common AI hallucinations
* Generated React components are always in sync with the actual database structure
* No more back-and-forth fixing incorrect type assumptions or mismatched field names

Some unexpected benefits I discovered:

* The AI generates much more precise TypeScript types since it has direct access to the schema
* RLS policies are automatically considered when generating data fetching logic
* Foreign key relationships are properly maintained in forms and data displays
* Schema changes are immediately reflected without needing to update context files

I've also developed a dynamic context system using gemini-2.0-pro-exp that automatically updates as your codebase context and instructions as it evolves, which has been a game-changer for larger projects. The AI seems to understand the codebase much better than with static  @ Codebase references.

Questions for the community:

* Has anyone else experimented with MCP for improving AI accuracy?
* What are your biggest pain points with Cursor generating database-connected components?
* Would you be interested in seeing this released as an open-source tool?

I'm particularly curious about your experiences with Cursor hallucinations in database-heavy applications and how you've addressed them.

From there, you could prompt Gemini—or whichever AI you're using—with a fine comb approach that breaks down the code into meaningful sections like specs, imports, auth, components, and relationships. The MCP would output each file into a dedicated folder, and you'd simply inform the AI composer where to find them, either by attaching the context in the chat or creating a `.cursorrule` with the right globs.

Cursor can send questions like “what are the ids of the button elements on he page” or even stuff like “why is the X button not visible” to this and get back answers which help it to write tests - just like how you might use the inspector to inspect the page when writing playwright.

cursor-tools uses stagehand to have another AI drive playwright so it’s more like teamwork between AI agents. 

Cursor can send high level instructions like “log in” and the other AI deals with figuring out what to do with the browser and it reports back how it gets on.

While I discard most of them for lacking unique value, some truly stand out. However, with the influx of options, it can be challenging to find the best ones. 

Here are some LLM tools I currently use:  

1. ChatGPT Mac app - primarily because of a team pro subscription.  

2. Repo Prompt - also due to the team pro subscription. However, it will soon shift to a paid plan, and I plan to switch to a free alternative or create my own version by forking PasteMax. I expect some MCP features will be introduced in the ChatGPT Mac app, or we may transition to Claude.  

3. [itsdart.com](http://itsdart.com) \- I have been using it daily since I installed it.  

4. Ollama - for testing models and more.  

5. Several tools from Simon Willison (https://simonwillison.net/) and his blog, which I read daily. I prefer this over getting lost in a flood of YouTube ""content"" creators, as it helps maintain my productivity.  

6. Talktastic as my VTT.  

7. Goose - I'm unsure about it; it's still buggy, and if we switch to Claude, I would likely stick with that.

One is for policy analysis. It takes a local ordinance and extracts variables and points of potential negotiations. It uses gpt4o at the moment and I'll be adding a search function that allows a model to search the web and find compatible ordinances. 

The second is an idea from almost ten years ago related to fantasy football. This is the one I'm currently iterating on. 

This is the one that almost made me emotional. When I got the main page to finally render I was kind of in shock. 

Back around 2016 I was able to assemble a small team to work on building this concept out. We got legal representation from u of Chicago and a clinic they run for entrepreneurs. We crafted a carve out piece of legislation (at that time fantasy sports were not exactly legal in Illinois), I got an offer from an investment group, we built the most basic backend function, and a basic landing page, and then my front end guy moved to Hollywood to make movies. My back end guy joined his fourth band, and development stopped so thereafter. 

I've always used the app idea as a test for these llms, not understanding what I was asking. They all failed miserably.

But in the last couple weeks I came across a new YouTube channel, cloned their app template and then started paying for cursor which allowed me to actually build out this app. I'm already WAY further along than we ever were in the past, and even have more features now that we have access to some new tools.

1j2rgj2,🚀 Just Released: Cursor Rules CLI - Auto-scan your project & install relevant Cursor rules in one command,"Disclaimer: This is a community-driven project not officially associated with Cursor.I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions! Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey r/cursor community!

I'm excited to share a tool I've been working on that makes finding and installing Cursor rules super easy: Cursor Rules CLI.

https://i.redd.it/sk0xovit2jme1.gif

What it does:

* 🔍 Automatically scans your project to detect libraries and frameworks
* 📥 Installs the most relevant Cursor rules directly to your rules folder
* 🎨 Beautiful, intuitive CLI interface
* 🔒 100% privacy-focused (all scanning happens locally)

How it works: Just run cursor-rules in your project directory, and it does all the work for you - no more manual searching or guessing which rules you need!

    pip install cursor-rules
    # Scan your project and install matching rules
    cursor-rules

What makes it special: The rules are created using a  two-step process:

1. Semantic search with Exa to gather best practices
2. LLM enhancement to create structured, optimized content

I have it build a heavy amount of unit testing. I make it get up to 80% code coverage (80% of the lines of code are tested). I also ask it to build end-to-end tests. For example, if I’m building an endpoint, I have it create the endpoint in a docker container. I have any dependencies like Redis or postresql spun up with fake data in a container. I also have a container spun up that pings this endpoint and ensures all of the pieces work. 

This is how I see it, unit testing is like building each piece of the bike to make sure it works. End to end testing makes sure you can ride the bike correctly.

1ipqiyg,Maximizing Cursor AI – What’s Your Best Workflow Hack?,"I’ve been using the Cursor pro plan for close to **4 months now**. I’m constantly trying out new ways to optimize my workflow to write code easier/faster.

**These have worked for me:**

* Optimizing `.cursorrules` by having the agent ""self-improve"" the rules after a coding session.
* Using debug statements liberally to help the agent find issues
* I ask it to start every reply with a random animal emoji 🦊. If I no longer see the emoji then I know it’s lost context

**Wins:**

* The self-improvement does seem to help to a point
* I am pretty hard core about starting new sessions an that helps a lot
* Debug statements do help it fix issues. Without them it tends to spin out.

**Losses:**

* Agent mode spins out when working on less popular tech (not js or react).
   * Firebase functions written in typescript
   * SwiftUI code
   * Svelte 5
* Forgetting to use a `.cursorrules` file or the new rules/\* in a project

mdnz9m9,,"I'm using Nuxt for two projects and this has been my workflow.

In ChatGPT Plus (webGUI), I have had a long chat, brainstorm session, detailing as much as possible: project summary, goals, milestones, features, etc. After I had all I _thought I needed_, I told ChatGPT to ask me 10 questions about the project to help it further understand. 

This took me about two days, answering in depth all I could about these projects. One is a ecommerce with NuxtUI, SquareAPI & Supabase. Other is for an automotive enthusiast community using Shadcn & Supabase. Both with Supabase buckets for storage, auth, members, uploads, etc.

I had ChatGPT + Canvas create a `readme-brainstorm.md` from all the information we generated. From there several others were created `readme-milestone-planning.md` and `readme-next-days-agenda.md`.

In Cursor, after init new project, install all dependencies, I told it to read the above readme docs and break it down into more manageable files. 

`readme-milestone-planning.md` has all the project goals, tasks, sub-tasks, version numbers for releases/deployments. We update this frequently throughout the day. Some of the larger tasks got their own docs file.

`readme-next-days-agenda.md` has 3 main headings: Current Project Status, Completed Today, and Next Steps. We refer to this at the start and end of my 'Daily Sprints'.

The second project has grown far more complex than initially anticipated. And we often times end up creating new `readme-*.md` docs. At this point I now have over a dozen markdown docs files: schema, seo, terms, testing-strategy, various features.

Also, I started with a basic `.cursorrules` file and tell Cursor to update as needed.

Example: sometimes it wants to install something we don't need or is already installed, or sometimes vee-validate would conflict with shadcn, or it would forget to use `<NuxtImg>` instead of `<img>`.

Recently we struggled to get proper form sumission handler typing correct. After we got the right syntax, I asked Composer ""what did we learn today?"", and it would outline what it did wrong and what the solution was. So I would tell it to add that solution to `.cursorrules`.

My cursorrules file is over 400 lines long. I got curious around 300 lines, thinking it was too big/complex. I've seen others use markdown for their rules, but mine is json formatted. I duplicated the cursorrules (.cursorrules-01 & .cursorrules-020, one in markdown, the other json structured. In Composer I told it to read both files and asked it which it preferred?! It actually chose the json structure. It said it preferred that method, so I told it to rewrite it to be more efficient, and it ended up restructuring the whole thing along with varying priorities, references to my other doc files, it listed all the Nuxt modules in use.

1j21lo8,Cursor vs Claude Code,"I've tried Claude Code over the last few days on a few Ruby on Rails 7 and 8 codebases that I work on.   
  
It's interesting, and it has a few features that would be good additions to Cursor.   
  
Compared to cursor:

The good:

* Very high code quality. This thing blows Cursor out of the water. I can't believe both use the same model when I see the difference in how Claude-3.7 behaves in Cursor and how it behaves in Claude Code. It's a completely different experience, on the same codebase with the same model. 
* It reports if its context is nearly filled, and allows you to compact it (summarise) or clear it. Great feature that Cursor should have too. 
* No 'can't connect to Anthropic' or 'can't connect to OpenAI' errors.
* Less errors compared to Cursor operating on the same codebase after writing code.
* I've had no functionality breaking mistakes, which do happen every now and then with Cursor, where it just breaks something or large files are truncated. 

The bad:

* It's not an IDE, but a node based terminal application that works on your codebase. That makes it a bit harder to work with (it would be fun to run it on an old VT200 terminal by the way). 
* The price! Working on just a few new features in a Rails app for around 3 hours kost me around $20,- in Claude Code. That's not cheap compared to what I pay for Cursor in a month and definitely something Claude should fix. 
* No MCP servers in Claude Code (at least I haven't been able to figure out how), though I haven't really missed them. Since it's a terminal app, Claude Code can execute all sorts of commands.   
* Cursor on the other hand is much cheaper, but that might also be its downfall. I'm perfectly willing to to pay more for Cursor if the quality it delivers is higher and more consistent.

1iqmbv7,Let Cursor & Windsurf interact with your Supabase autonomously,"So... this weekend I've had some time on my hands and decided to finally explore how to build and work with MCP servers.

Well... it turns out if you connect Supabase to Cursor / Windsurf via MCP server you essentially get an AI database agent that can not only write SQL queries (baby stuff), but actually:

* execute them
* debug them
* iterate on them

It's now possible to just ask it ""Count the number of messages my users sent"" and it will iterate until completion. 🤯 Check out how it works in the demo video.

\---

**How to set it up:**

* Clone the repo
* Install dependencies
* Add MCP server to Cursor & Windsurf
* Enjoy! 🙌

There are more detailed instructions in the README file of the repo itself.

* run with `supabase-mcp-server`

to clarify the step:

1. Create .env file and fill in project ref and password env vars only if you need to connect to staging / production db. Connection to a local instance should be handled by default as long as you didn't modify the default host and port and password

2. There will be not terminal window popping up after you connect to Cursor. 

3. After adding an MCP server to Cursor, connection is colored green, you don't get any notifications from IDE, but once you go into an agent mode in Compose, your agent should have access to tools.

Those two are different things entirely. Think of an MCP server like an intermediary between Cursor and your Supabase instance which exposes 'tools' for Cursor agent to use. In this case, the MCP server I built enables IDEs to execute SQL queries, but I plan to expand on the tools functionality to include support for all Python SDK methods and objects

We have open source agents now that work directly with models (via your own API key) such as anthropics own Claude code. RooCode looks interesting too. This is fundamentally against Cursor's model in my opinion and not sustainable.

mcd5wig,,"First of all, Cursor is not ""AI"", it's a program that uses AI to do many things. So you can criticize cursor's integration of AI, and also the AI separately.

Many of the LLMs in Cursor are, indeed, very poorly optimized for many purposes. That's why you have to learn what things they're good at, and which aren't. You already stated you use it, so you should know a few of these things.

For example, if you're having a complex bug in a piece of code, just giving it to sonnet or gpt-4o is most likely not going to give you a solution. LLMs are trained from autocomplete models, so they're likely to follow a pattern.

- Sonnet, for example, is trained to always think it knows what the problem is, so it will confidently propose changes that do nothing, or even worse, break the program more than it already was broken.
- gpt-4o has a good general picture of things, sometimes better than sonnet, especially for strategy, but it's much poorer regarding implementation and troubleshooting.
- deepseek r1 has a very good thinking process, which you can copypaste into sonnet to get much better troubleshooting from the thinking and observation of the more ""thoughtful"" model (r1), and then hand it to the more optimized ""implementation"" model (sonnet)
- o1 is very good at both thinking and implementation, though not necessarily better in all things than sonnet, but it can definitely read code better and find hidden issues more easily.
- o1 pro, when used from the ChatGPT Pro interface, is much better than the normal o1, due to the unlimited allotted thinking time, which is very short compared to r1 for example

I would say that Copilot is better at being autonomous - I gave it a list of tasks to complete and it just does them. Cursor will do one task, stop and then wait until you tell it to continue.

Apart from that, Cursor is better and I noticed just how much better when I moved back to it when I got rate lmited.

mbtotcl,,"It's interesting to see everyone's take on this. GitHub Copilot has been around before GPT3 even came out. It was the OG code completion tool. Recently, I've only played around with Cursor Chat, so I don't have a personal opinion, but based on what I've seen in testing results, Cursor seems like the most polished coding assistant out there rn.

Here's my two cents: even though all these AI assistants are built on basically the same underlying models, the real magic  happens in how they handle context. The way each tool picks and feeds in context—and then fine-tunes the model to produce the output the IDE expects—is crucial. If any of those steps are off, the model ends up asking for extra prompts to fix itself. The more iterations you need for a single feature, the longer your context gets, which only increases the chances for the AI to get all confused and mess up its output. Cursor is opaque, so I don't really know how it works, but it must have trained some pretty good custom models for RAG, context management, and output alignment.

If you're letting AI write your code, you should want something that consistently spits out correct code. Code correctness is worth way more than a measly $10, especially if you're relying on it for more than just learning.

After spending >500 hours in the last 2 months with AI-assisted IDEs (namely Cursor and Windsurf), I can easily say that for a senior developer, these tools improve your productivity to create a full-scale project by at least 50x. If you already have the full-stack knowledge of creating an application (web or mobile), it's amazingly fast to develop.

It's not all sunshine and rainbows, of course. As we all live the very early days of these tools, there were many times I felt too frustrated by the unpredictable performance of these tools. I spent literally hours to just try to ""make tool do the job"" for some relatively simple tasks. For the sake of ""learning"" how to use these tools optimally, I stayed mostly persistent and got the job done every time (like almost).

On the other hand, for a beginner level or mid level developer, I don't see an easy path to create full-scale production ready apps with these tools ""yet"". There's going to be A LOT OF challenges you'll run into and LLMs will try things as if they fell into some infinite cycle of unsuccessful attempts. You must know how to lead them and put them into the right direction. Otherwise, you can't finish an actual product.

Cursor is incentivized to reduce tokens to save on costs. The problem is it's just model + tokens that result in quality. Reducing tokens directly reduces quality.  

Here are two obvious solutions:  
1. Another tier of membership. I'll pay $50 or $100 a month (maybe more) to have unconstrained tokens. Let me add all the context I want to every prompt up like 50% the token limit (this is when model performance starts degrading due to needle-in-haystack effect iirc).  
2. Give me a toggle to avoid the token-limiting behavior and let me pay per token after some reasonable limit for the $20 service. I'll pay more for quality!!

Never remove or change code unless necessary. Always inform verbosely why code is being deleted instead of updated. Always only update or add code related to the task.

Never make a module larger than 200 lines if it can be avoided. Split even the smallest of features up into reusable microservices/microcomponents.

When a codefile is complete, add its name to .frozen in the project root. Files listed in .frozen are never to be touched without my explicit permission. If adaptation is needed, do it in the code you're working on instead. We can refactor and optimize later.""

mbpav6w,,"In the past i tried software developing, django, flask, but everytime i stopped because i could not learn the html and sometimes javascript. I have data engineering background, I know how a database model should look like in applications, and I know how to write python (and sql). 

I started, again, to build webapps with django and flask, bit now with cursor... it blowed my mind!! I build 10 webapps in the last 14 days. 

No it is not first time right,
Yes, the most stupid things do not work,

My tips for now, maybe obvious but:
- start always first in git,
- create first the basic hello world and try to deploy it. (I use azure webapp) (if you try to deploy your big app at the end it is very hard to deploy.
- then i use chat gpt to create a killer prompt, (take your time for this, make a prompt that describes your app in detail, focus on functional requirements, step bij step, and data model.
- from here i start the composer, and step bij step the composer will ask, shall i implement a, shall i implement b. Check every time in between if it works, if not, fix it. (The annoying part you mentioned as well)
- in python be sure what version of the packages you use, i try the newest, and from there I set it fixed to a version, so there will be no conflicts. Sometimes cursor will Come with code that belongs to another version that will not work. Add then the website as a reference or just copy paste the instructions that belongs to that specific version. 
- sometimes you tried several options to fix something, but it is not working. Go back and try technical another approach. You can ask for another approach but you might give cursor a hint.
- learn about what options you have without the composer, with google and chatgpt like apps, learn to understand what it does, i think then you get the best prompts with eventually the best result.

To tackle this, I started by creating a documentation directory in the project. I wrote up an overview of the system and a database schema summary to get a high-level understanding. Then, I systematically went through different parts of the codebase, using Cursor to generate Mermaid diagrams and detailed explanations of how each repo functions. Once I mapped out the individual repos, I compiled everything into a system architecture document that outlines how all the pieces interact.

This has been an absolute game changer, not only for understanding the codebase but also for keeping the ""big picture"" in mind when working on tasks. Now, instead of spending hours reverse-engineering code, I can prompt Cursor Chat with a task, and it will pull relevant documentation, explain what needs to be changed, and even suggest the key files I should include in Composer.

mboi1tn,,"Do not use an extremely long cursorrules. Make it short and concise. Add a line to cursor rules to make sure the ai model is reading it, something like please end your responses with a :). If you don't see the :) it means you're providing too much context to the ai in your prompts and it's overwhelmed. ""Do not silently fix errors or remove code"", ""do not make assumptions"", ""always ask questions"" are some of my rules. 

Its important to explicitly tell the ai anytime it wants to make an assumption or if it isn't sure about anything regarding code or requirements, it must ask questions to clarify. This is crucial. It will give you a list of questions after your prompt and you must answer it thoroughly. 

Often ai models will recognize there's a lot of code implementation to do (error management, loading displays, code reuse), dont have it do this while you're trying to solve a bug or make an implementation of a feature. Either do this before or after your implementations. 

Never have the ai model code too much. One feature/task at a time. 

Use new composer chats after each feature. 

Have a document in your repo outlining core requirements for your overall app. Have a document specifically outlining requirements for the page or feature your trying to implement with ai. Without requirements the ai is going to make a bunch of assumptions and you'll need to clarify it. 

I have coding principles in my cursorrules but I often remind the ai to implement code based off the principles. 
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Don't Repeat Yourself Principle (DRY)
Keep it Simple Stupid Principle (KISS)

Mentioning these 3 principles helps make sure the ai checks its work after it recommends a solution. 

For your first prompt about a feature implementation or bug investigation, ask the ai to outline its investigation or solution implementation plan in detailed English (no code). Assess the response and correct any mistakes it has. It's better to do this in English rather than code.

**Update 1:**

You can ""stack"" your cursor  rules.

In the screenshot you can see that I have a ""global"" rule and a specific rule for extensions.

you can also see that in the reasoning step in the composer.

**Sidenote:** Some User reports that it crashes cursor so use this with caution

**Update 2:**

Cursor Rules supports inheritance. If you have ever worked with CSS, this should be a familiar concept.

For example, create a base .mdc rule and reference it in your other rules. Keeps everything clean and separate.

**Update 3:**

Regarding deprecated .cursorrules. Smth. in me hopes that doesn't happen → everyone needs to migrate. In the long run, the name .cursorrules is an understatement of the agent's powerful capabilities.

Workaround: Create an \[whateveryouwant\].mdc (agent was just an example) file as an replacement for the .cursorrules. Add the ""\*"" for global (missed it in the screenshot)

1j17kgo,Quick Guide: Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP (talk to your database),"**Quick Guide: Connecting Supabase to Cursor via MCP**

If you're trying to hook up your Supabase database with Cursor (using MCP), here's a quick, straightforward guide. This setup lets you interact directly with your database through natural language—so you can just tell Cursor Composer what you want (like querying data, adding tables, etc.) without fiddling with manual SQL every time.

I struggled for hours last night because I skipped this step at first. Without this, Cursor just couldn't get accurate context from Supabase, even when I fed it the docs directly.

Here's what worked for me:

**Step 1: Get your Supabase connection string**

* Log in at [Supabase]() and pick your project.
* Head over to your project's connection settings.
* You’ll see a connection string there. Replace any placeholder passwords with your actual database password.
* Copy this entire connection string (you'll need it for Cursor).

**Step 2: Add your MCP server in Cursor**

* Open Cursor and navigate to Settings → Features.
* Scroll down past the ""Codebase indexing"" section until you see the MCP servers area.
* Click on **""Add New MCP Server""**.
   * Set type as **Command**.
   * Name it clearly (mine is just ""Supabase - My App"").
   * Paste the connection string you copied from Supabase here.
* Hit save.

**Step 3: Try it out**

* Now you can use Cursor Composer or similar tools to run queries directly against your Supabase database without leaving Cursor.
* Run a quick test (like asking it for a list of tables) to make sure it's connected properly.

Quick tip from experience—make sure you back up your database first. I didn't, and cleaning up mistakes afterwards took ages.

Hope this saves someone else the headache!

1ip5qfz,One of the best things with Cursor,"Is that it allows me to never leave the ”creative phase”. More and more ideas and enhancements pop ups all the time because I don’t have to spend my energy on implementation details. 

It allows me to spend my energy on enhancements and the architectural decisions that really matter. 


I honestly think that one of the reasons why some people dislike the AI evolvement right now is because they find joy from the small details, from writing specific code. And this is OK - for personal projects or if it’s a demand that the code needs to be 100% perfect and follow all best practices. But in reality, most customers doesn’t care about these details. They want their software to solve their problems.

I wouldn’t let cursor generate as much code as I do if I were writing software for a bloody rocket or a self-driving vehicle where every single detail matters but that’s not what I do. That’s not what most people do. I’m so tired of people thinking that the software they create is revolutionary.

Commented above. Stop lashing out at the rest of the community and post actual evidence.

I can go blue in the face repeating that this has always been an issue, and that the same behavior can be seen in other interfaces including Anthropic's own, but whatever. It's not wrong to include, but you have *got* to back this up with something more than a single generation (which looks fine to me). Even if I thought your generation looked sus, what would that prove? Think about it.

I created [https://pricepergig.com/](https://pricepergig.com/) \- a site to sort, filter, find all the cheapest hard disk drives, SSD and NVMe drives, order by price per GB/TB and now, get instant alerts so you get the cheapest prices.

The problem? Send email alerts to people with the current cheapest HDD, SSD, NVMe drive on their chosen Amazon store for their chosen threshold. e.g. I want amazon co uk hard disks, known brands, where they are less than £13/TB, don't send me anything more expensive than that.

I worked out, with about 8 amazon websites, known brands, unknown brands, HDD, SSD, and NVMe, that a total of 72 different 'lists' on something like Mailchimp (I don't know if it can do variables, Mautic can, but one look at the docs and I'm thinking, but Cursor can just do this).

ANYWAY - I'm a developer with super powers (aka Cursor) so I'll just write my own...

I use my spec document technique, and only 304 words, played on the xbox for 20 mins (I am terrible at Warzone), clicked 'accept' a bunch of times, went to make a cup of tea to review and BOOM, I had 'confirmation' emails AND a fully working 'alert' email. 

It would have taken me longer to make the two email templates alone! This is incredible .

Thanks @ Cursor.  


\# Only if you're interested, here are the prompts #

  
Using my spec document technique, I wrote the spec - and I'm cheating a bit here, I'm not including these words in the word count BECAUSE I'd have to a) write this for a human to implement or b) go read all the docs for mailchimp or mautic and click around for hours figuring it out, so this, imo, is less work than any of those.

    # Goal
    
    We want to send emails to users when they have certain thresholds of listings.
    
    # Features
    
    User's on the front end can subscribe to emails, at that point they choose the options they would like notifications for along with a price per TB or price per GB. threshold to be met.
    When the best price in that category is met, we send an email to the user with the listing details and link directly to the listing.
    
    We will store the users email address and preferences in a table.
    
    We need a front end for the user to manage their email preferences. 
    Users should have to double opt in / confirm their email address for it to become active on the list. 
    
    we should use the same react components for the user preferences as we do on the main site/subscribe component.
    
    we will also need a super simple front end looking component that takes just the user's email address. when a user enters their email address and a threshold price we should send that to the backend and store it in the database, then send the user a confirmation email, once the user confirms their email address we should update the user's status to active on the list. The user can then update their exact preferences.
    
    ## User preferences
    Users can choose from the following options to get notified for:
                ""nvme-m2"" - Cheapest NVMe M.2 SSD (any brand)
                ""nvme-m2-branded"" - Cheapest NVMe M.2 SSD (known branded)
                ""ssd-internal"" - Cheapest Internal SSD (any brand)
                ""ssd-internal-branded"" - Cheapest Internal SSD (known branded)
                ""hdd-internal"" - Cheapest Internal HDD (any brand)
                ""hdd-internal-branded"" - Cheapest Internal HDD (known branded)
    you will find we already calculate the best price for any item in the database in the pricepergig-backend-webapi/webapi/PPG.Services/BestListingService.cs file. we already have a webhook, we just need to add the logic to call an email service or similar there with the new best listing details - then the new notification service will handle the rest (find users that wanted that notification/threshold etc. and send them an email)
    
    Users can choose their language, but during the signup process we should just default to the currently selected language on the site (set in /ppg/pricepergig-frontend/src/Header.tsx and not need to ask the user this. they can change it on the larger preferences page later if they want to)
    
    
    ## User Interface components/things
    1 - simple sign up form - we get the users email address and the threshold price they want to be notified for.
    2 - confirmation email - we send a confirmation email to the user's email address, once they confirm their email address we update the user's status to active on the list. The user can then update their exact preferences.
    3 - preferences page - the user can update their exact preferences from this page, they can also unsubscribe from the list here.
    4 - unsubscribe link - the user can unsubscribe from the list from this page - but it will just take them to the preferences page.
    
    # Technologies
    
    We will use a hosted SMTP service to send the emails such as SendGrid, but we'll need the smtp details to configure this - they can be configured in the pricepergig-backend-webapi/webapi/EnvironmentVariables.cs file.
    
    We will use hangfire to handle the scheduling of the emails, this way we can 'fire and forget' and not have to keep the application running to send the emails as each time hangfire is started it will resume the emails job from where it left off.# Goal

And, this is my prompts, and if you read, you'll see, a good few prompts were because I had a file called EmailService already that didn't actually do anything other than send me one email each day so I knew the server was up and running.



1. update this file with the single storypoint tasks, make them a check list so that you can follow it later. you should read the codebase and make it clear what you can do - make a good PLAN you can execute later

1. Implement each of the # Single Storypoint Task in thsi file, you shoudl implement them and tick them off as you go. think hard, work methodically. complete the ENTIRE WORKLOAD - keep reminding yourself to look back at this task list and complete it.
2. the migration was created coontinue, you MUST update the Email list document tick boxes as you go

1. continue
2. hey, why don't you try building the back end and fixing the errors
3. try cd pricepergig-backend/webapi dotnet build
4. the problem is u/EmailService.cs and u/EmailService.cs I think the one in the utils folder should be renamed to EmailSenderService
5. ok, now run the new unit tests if you can, we've never done that before in here.
6. you don't need to mock them, just create them and use them and pass them in right? why mock something that dons't need mocking?
7. update this and write some simple instructions for me to test, e.g. i can't even 'see' the subscribe box
8. ok, you've used a new framework for api calls, axios . I think these api calls are simple, just use the native fetch apis go read u/App.tsx as to examples of us using this. now update your email code to use that on the front end so we don't need more libraries.
9. yeah do we need api.pricepergig.com? I don't know what that's about we always use 'baseurl'/api/ instead so can you follow the same, because otherwise that another domain to setup. perhaps you don't know how backened api is, it's just backend.pricepergig.com - api would have been better, but never mind, it's backend.pricepergig.com



I really need to get cursor to not go adding random frameworks, maybe a more complete # Technology section? How do you deal with that?

The more requests you make in the slow pool, the longer your wait time for the month can extend. 

Check out the Models page in our docs to see all of the models we offer and their pricing. Non-premium models that are not free require you to enable usage-based pricing and do not qualify for the 500 request allotment. For example, o1 is $0.40 per request.

mcmnx50,,"there isnt anything close to cursor. was paying for all 3 at once (third being copilot) and now i just pay 40-60/month for cursor + cline with my own api keys.

cline with my own API keys is still incredibly useful tool to have for really straightforward but ""bulky"" stuff needing large amounts of text. much cheaper than any other SaaS editor and works in cursor too so ya dont have to change anything, but Cursor has an incredibly well implemented agentic workflow that no one else has gotten close to. Cursor is more likely to figure out that its fucking up and fix itself, but it seemed to end up more expensive to be spamming vs windsurf, and much more than cline.

otherwise its like cursor >>>windsurf>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>copilot. 

they all occasionally hit feature parity for brief moments, until cursor releases somethin new a week later, but the UX of cursor is so much better. @ docs is simpler, adding them, rules, etc it all just makes sense. Agent is constantly getting better and with o3mini being 1/3rd a fast request, you get a lot for 20$. smart choice between models can save a ton.

1itwarj,"Reflection of Cursor vs Windsurf. Normally I wouldn’t have tried Windsurf, but…","Guys, I have been switching over from cursor and there's a couple of things that are a little bit annoying me in my workflow:

1) Not being able to simply drag and drop the relevant files from the file tree into the Cascade/Chat.

2) Having no clear distinction of the chat and the cascade, whereas in cursor, I had those two nicely separated. So I had a nice separation of concerns there where I could blast off questions in unrelated topics on the chat side and then do feature buildouts via the composer side. That's something that I'm missing as well.

3) Sometimes when cascades builds something out and when I click to see the code it has written, it doesn't even highlight. So it was very hard to see what exactly changed

4) In cursor, the sidebar is actually sitting on top of the file tree explorer. Is there any way to change it back to the top like it is in cursor?  I feel like that part takes off a significant amount of screen real estate in a sense that it can cut off some file namings and I have to decrease my code view.



What I like about Windsurf:

1) Better clarity on the token usage.

2) The UI looks very clean and nice and the branding is growing on me.

3) Deepseek v3 free

4) minor aspects of the experience that makes you feel that they are much more polising the product, whereas it feels as cursor might be experiencing an increasing level of bureacracy.

5) Better pricing and high usage tier.




The reality of the matter is I wouldn't have even changed to Windsurf if it weren't for the deprecation of adding more fast requests to cursor. I actually only later saw that putting in your own API key would actually be almost the same cost as if it were for paying regular 500 requests, but that wasn't clearly communicated in their user experience (but then why depricate it?)  So that's what ultimately got me to move to cursor and check it out.",2025-02-20 03:23:55,20,23,0.92,cursor,Jarie743,True,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1itwarj/reflection_of_cursor_vs_windsurf_normally_i/

But other than that I have recently worked with Windsurf again after some weeks while ""surfing"" along with Cursor most of the time.

I agree about 1, don't agree about 2 - i like the more seemless switching ability. But that might depend on workflow. 

I don't agree on most of your other points

1. while cursor isn't great there, windsurf just isn't as well.   
2. agree on that while i don't care too much about it, cursor is good enough for me  
3. Couldn't care less, can't make it work properly - sonnet 3.5 is still king for me  
4. can't see where   
5. LOL no - have you ever worked with it? Token usage in cascade is enourmous especially if it decides to run through some bug fixing loops. Additionally you really need to take care to not break things easily in these runs.

You can absolutely use more fast requests on Cursor and it's even better - you don't have to buy them in packages but pay them one by one with the same price as in the packages before. Not sure what your complaint is here to be honest.

Overall for me Windsurf has some nice things over Cursor but below the line Cursor still works better for me.

I do think the cool thing about both tools is that they are competing neck and neck right now and the market share is going to go ultimately to the tool that adjusts to users preferences. I probably will continue to pay for both tools and have sessions with each from time to time.

mdv6qm4,,"Same questions, same files, same rules, same models etc cursor always provide better or working solutions for me (backend python), most probably cursor handles better the communication between user and the model (with system prompts, whatever magic they are doing)

Agent mode in cursor is so talented, can handle multiple tasks at the same time and will hit the wall with 25 requests. Unfortunately there is no way to control this, sometimes it stops with 3-4 steps and asks the user if it should continue with the left tasks, sometimes it finishes them all. I strongly believe this is related to Claude rather than cursor.( I can’t wait a model surpasses Claude with coding so we will not have to use that company’s products ever again). 

Anyway windsurf usage is weird, again with the similar tasks it always consumes much more than cursor. Especially if you are giving multiple tasks at the same time it counts them separately while cursor not (until 25 it is still one).

1. Ask Cursor to create a shell script at your repo root that copies all repo content to clipboard in LLM-ready format
2. Run the script to get your entire codebase context
3. Paste this context into a browser-based LLM (Claude, GPT, Gemini on AI Studio,etc)
4. Describe your bug alongside the full context

When you subscribe to the $20/month Pro plan, you can use your own API keys, but you'll likely find the best performance and pricing using the models provided by Cursor instead. Due to the volume we buy from these providers each month, we have much higher rate limits and lower pricing.

Check out the Models page in our docs for more details on what we offer and pricing: [https://docs.cursor.com/settings/models](https://docs.cursor.com/settings/models)

All models with a checkmark in the Premium column count against the 500 monthly requests that come with your Pro account. Once you've exhausted your 500 requests, we continue to serve these to you, but during peak periods you may be dropped into our slow pool, which can cause longer delays in receiving responses. If you want to avoid the slow pool and/or use non-Premium models that are not free, you can enable usage-based pricing from the Settings page at [https://www.cursor.com/settings](https://www.cursor.com/settings) and pay per request.

There are a couple ways to mitigate this.

mfgntr2,,"Claude 3.7 in Cursor is eager — sometimes a bit too eager. Like a programmer who's had one espresso too many. Sure, the code works, but often at the cost of unnecessary complexity — adding extra if-statements ""just in case,"" even when simpler patterns would suffice.

Some might call this ""defensive programming."" Perhaps folks from the Java world even appreciate this style. I prefer to call it ""unnecessary bloat."" Yes, it might boost the percentage of working code (and thus look better in benchmarks), but complexity matters — a lot. Not just for aesthetics (though I admit holding the minority view that clean code is valuable in itself), but because overly complex code makes future changes harder and more error-prone, whether done manually or by Claude 3.7 itself.

For example, I asked Claude to move CSS into a separate file instead of embedding it in a Python string. It did exactly that—but then, just to be safe, also inlined the CSS anyway.

Another common pattern: when I request removing unnecessarily long imports, Claude often hesitates, leaving them in place ""just in case."" Unfortunately, this happens frequently.

Still, I don't mean to imply that Claude 3.7 is bad.

1ijxt96,"Testing Cursor Pro for a month, here are my impressions","Hey guys, just wanted to share my experience with cursor and AI agents

I'm a react native developer and I was working on a react native upgrade, it was a really complex task so I wasn't expecting anything from cursor, but just as a test I asked for it to ""upgrade the react native version to version 0.72.17, check the libraries in package.json and upgrade them to the version that had compatibility with react antive 0.72.17""

Well, as I expected, it was a shit show, AI hallucinated and started to use random versions of libraries, terrible... 0/10

After that I started doing it manually and tried to use cursor to check the compatibility matrix with the react native I was targeting, I was hopeful that cursor could save me a few inutes for every package that I was upgrading, and the results? Terrible again, AI agents couldnt find the correct compatibility matrix and tried to add the wrong version of the libraries, at this point it was increasing my workload instead of decreasing... 0/10

So I decided to upgrade and search the compatiblity matrix by myself, did all the setup manually and I was ready to start the compile of my binary, I was expecting build errors. Every time a new build error appeared I tried to ask cursor for a fix, the agent seems to be progressing slowly and going on the right direction, but after a few hours running in circles I decided to drop everything they done and search the errors directly using google. I fixed it in 40min... 0/10

Well everything seems to be working now and cursor had a total of at least -5 in contributions, meaning that they improved my workload instead of decreasing, but that's fine, after all I did read that most of the AI agents excelled in automated tests.

Now I do have a LARGE suite of tests that I need to pass through and fix. Since the AI agent seems a bit  dumb I wouldnt dare to ask it to run the tests and fix it, so I found a test suite that was breaking and asked it to run.  
So my test suit had 48 unit tests, and it was breaking in 19 of those tests due to the changes in libraries and versions. To fix it we only needed to update the mocks of the tests, so I asked cursor to run the test file and fix the issue, and oh boy, if cursor was bad before now it was terrible  
The AI agent started changing and breaking my JS file (not the .test.js file), and instead of fixing the test file it tried to change my original file to make the test pass, it was like it tried to work in reverse order, breaking the app to make a broken test pass... Anyway after almost 40min trying different composers and agents I decided to fix it manually, upgraded the mocks and fixed everything in 15min, all tests are passing... 0/10

Anyway, after 1 month testing and trying to use cursor and AI agents, my experience is that it increased my workload and interfered with my productivity, so my final rating for cursor pro and AI agents at this moment is

mbiqeo7,,"My Tips for Using Cursor AI:

1. Use composer in normal mode.
2. Give it context. Load specific files into Composer so the AI knows what it's working with. It makes a huge difference.
3. Take it one step at a time. Don’t overload it with too many tasks at once. Smaller, focused prompts work best.
4.  Reset when needed. If things start getting messy or off-track, start a fresh Composer session.
5. Pick the right model. Not all models are great for every task. I mostly use Claude Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o for general coding, o1 for trickier problems, and recently o3-mini. Gemini models and GPT-4o mini haven’t worked well for me.

Some background. I’m a lawyer, not a programmer. But when ChatGPT first launched, I saw the potential of combining basic programming knowledge with LLMs to bring some side projects to life. So, over the last two years, I taught myself some Python. A few months ago, I decided to try building my first iOS app. I had ZERO experience with SwiftUI, so I relied entirely on ChatGPT. It was both fun and frustrating—especially because I had to manually copy-paste everything into Xcode. Then, I discovered Cursor AI (Composer), its ""Accept / Apply"" feature, and it was a game-changer. My apps are simple but fully functional. Two of them are used by hundreds of people every week, and one just arrived on the App Store today. I built all of them to fulfill my own needs—never really intending to make a lot of money (that said, I've made about $200 so far).

For this, I did separate projects and cross-reference the back to the front adding swagger to the go backend, then I pasted the openapi.json in the frontend.  
2. Too much .mdc/.cursorrules: With the change from .cursorrules to .mdc, I did lots of .mdc files. Also, I did the 'scratchpad.md' thing. It was nice, but the quality of the responses also declined. For this, I just did the minimal, concise things that I needed.

mgyvo4h,,"it’s easy. I made one yesterday. Tell cursor with sonnet 3.7 in agent mode that you want to make a threejs game with a python backend for websocket multiplayer.
Then explain the game you want. it’s best to start simple and then tackle a feature at a time.
Once you get to a few thousand lines it starts to screw up a lot.

I had to have cursor make me new tooling just to make my game, like creating hitboxes on the head of an axe so it would only hurt the enemy when the actual axe hits them; also for correctly connecting weapons to bones using offsets. I went a little HAM, you don’t have to. use sketchfab for free models.",2025-03-09 20:46:33,1,0,0.0,cursor,DeveloperOfStuff,False,Reddit (r/cursor),https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1j6vk9j/how_did_this_guy_code_a_whole_game_with_cursor/mgyvo4h/
