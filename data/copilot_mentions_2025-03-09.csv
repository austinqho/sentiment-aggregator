Anyways, as for your issue, the way I dealt with it when I used to use copilot was by adding comments or restructuring code around the trigger words that let the AI know that they are related to the task in hand. For example, I was working on a bad word filter and had an array of bad words. As soon as I added ""fuck"" all suggestions stopped working. Renaming the array to ""filterWords"" solved the issue. So you could for example, restructure your code to let it know that those are attack types. If you do not want to restructure your code, you can try adding comments near the words such as ""// when the player dies"", ""// when the player presses space"", etc. Good luck.",2025-02-17 12:09:22,6,0,0.0,github,zane_erebos,False,Reddit (r/github),https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/1irt1rw/copilot_filtering/mdb1boj/

What I usually tend to do is write something and then wait for a suggestion that sometimes is suitable and sometimes much less.

So I wanted to ask if you have any suggestions to give me on how to interact with the copilot.

In particular, the questions I asked myself are the following:  
\-              How many characters do you type before waiting for a suggestion?

\-              How long do you wait for a suggestion before resuming typing?

\-              Do you ever delete and retype a part of the code to get a different suggestion from Copilot? 

\-              How do you react when Copilot doesn't provide a relevant suggestion?

My ideal solution would be something similar to a “.copilotignore” file (or a configuration option within VSCode) that would allow me to disable Copilot’s access to files containing sensitive data.

I have been trying to sign in to GitHub from vscode for about two weeks now and to no avail

I believe I have tried everything, searched the web for similar issues but for the first time no one had a similar issue, I have tried every AI chat there is, Gpt, deep seek, even copilot on github's website but nothing.

the issue looks very simple which is why it has dumbfounded me so much.

here's how it goes: vscode says I have to sign in to github to use associated features like copilot or to save my code in a repository, but when I do a pop up appears on the bottom right that says signing in to github.

I have stared at this pop up for longer than I can admit.

eventually after a couple minutes it says I haven't finished configuring the authenticator extension or something and says it will try to sign in using a local host, another half an hour and after it fails, gives me a code to past on the website to sign in, I do that and it says your all set, returning to vs code reveals that I am indeed not all set. as it gives me an ""Error signing in to github"" ""try again"" in a smug way

at first I thought nothing of it and it wasn't a big deal until a couple of days ago when I lost a big chunk of a project I've been working on for my collage

I'm so frustrated with every thing about this as no one seems to relate and I feel like the only one with this issue

I saw a post on stackoverflow for someone with what he described to be a similar issue to mine but no one seemed to know why and no solution to the problem was posted

here's a bunch of things I tried to do but didn't work

1. I'm working from home so no firewall or vpn or anything similar to try and block the extension I think.
2. tried to manually sign in using github from the terminal by configuring my user name and email. still nothing.
3. cleared any previous credentials stored on the extension if there was any since it didn't work once. nope. not it.
4. uninstall and reinstall, multiple times, nah.
5. use the token, most AI bots suggested, I don't have two factor authentication but still tried it, nothing.
6. made sure I was signed in to github on my browser before trying any of these by the way,
7. reinstall vs code because why not, god damnit.
8. check developer tools console for any warnings or errors for the network, you guessed it.

if you see this and don't know what to do please upvote maybe someone who has a similar problem sees it and hopefully has a solution, if you do I will include you in my prayers.

I would give my hand and or leg for any clue about this as it no longer is about saving my code from withering away due to power outages but is now about my dignity and self respect as a junior developer.

1isa99s,Locked out of an account with ongoing subscription,"First of all and in my defense I was very young when I set up my github account first year of school about a decade ago, barely ever touched it after that, quickly set up sub for Copilot at some point and never bothered to check my old student email for warnings about 2FA.

Now I don't know if I didn't set up 2FA properly or if someone got access to my account and set it up for themseleves (account looks fine, old public repositories ok, no visible activity on my profile) but it sure is enabled and I have essentially no way to log in ever again. 

Whatever, such is the game of 2FA, fine. It's an old student account with almost nothing on it anyway.

However, my subscription is still going. I made a support request (TERRIBLE system when you can't log in by the way) to have it cancelled in late December. No answer a month and a half later, and still being billed.

Now, the next steps available to me are a legal private information deletion request (legal in my country) or getting a whole ass new credit card just for github. Needless to say it would be a massive hassle.

Picture a codebase with a very strict TSConfig and ESLint config. When the AI generates code, it generates non-compliant code. It then finds a bajillion errors that AI fundamentally cannot understand or fix.

merxqf3,,"Thanks for developing these features and getting to answer some questions. I have a few:

1. Will the agents feature cost extra to regular copilot? Will there be faster and slower requests depending on your subscription? A ballpark figure would be fine
1. Will the agents feature allow selecting different AI models to send questions to?
1. When do you guess this is going to move to stable? Ballpark figure is fine as well, I understand there can be a long road ahead.
1. Why is it called Copilot when under the hood it uses the Claude model? I thought all Copilot branding from Microsoft uses the ChatGPT and other OpenAI models?
1. Are there third party AI assistants you look at for inspiration and what features you saw them implement that you just had to have?
1. Will there be a solution to automatically import dependencies with autocomplete or do you really rely on agents to do that?
1. Will Copilot in the future implement eslint/stylelint/htmlhint and other linters to write the code how you want it?
1. Will copilot be open to third party extensions to implement as AI backend or have them use AI for certain features too or will it be limited to what VSCode and Copilot decide?
1. Will third party extensions get the same API's for VSCode that Copilot is using?

I have had some experience with Cline and Cursor. I love how they can do all kinds of things automatically and think there's a big future to having them do stuff. Still a lot of work to do and fine-tune because at times they still make stuff up, keep circling around the same solution or get confused about the issues to fix. Or that it refuses to look into my constants and interface (files) to see what the object will be like. But I also noticed that its a lot more expensive than what a regular subscription is able to do.

mes4fe3,,"Thanks for interesting questions. Let me answer, but keep in mind that this is my personal point of view as a VS Code product manager.  
1. Right now I am not aware of any no plans to change the cost structure. So agent mode will be available to Free/Pro/Business/Enterprise.

2. It already allows (claude 3.5, 3.7, gpt-4o) - give it a try!

3. I already answered that in this discussion. Rough estimate mid-March

4. This is a more of a marketing / branding question. But just because it is called Copilot does not mean it must only talk to OpenAI models. I do not think we as MS ever made that statement for any of the Copilot products.

5. We already get a large amount of user feedback / feature requests. So as always just listening to our users gives us enough signals to decide what to do next

6. Regular suggestions (non AI ones) can auto import on accept sometimes. It makes sense that GH Copilot supports this. Please file a feature request [https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release) and ping me at isidorn

7. Agent mode already listens on lint / error changes via the getErrors tool and auto-corrects

8. We already have a Chat and Language Model extensibility story [https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release) and [https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model) and we continuously try to expand our API surfaces. So tell us what you would like to see, and share your scenarios!

9. Per each API we decide if we want to finalise it and expose it to all extensions or not. So far we have finalised: completions, chat, language model, shell integration (that Cline extension send kudos to us for doing). Having said that there are still APIs that are proposed and not possible to be used by all 3rd party extensions. Finalising APIs is an investment for our small team, so we carefully decide what we finalise.

From time to time, my CPU gets stuck at 100% after using Copilot. It’s not just a spike, it’s constant and seems like it could last indefinitely.

In Windows Task Manager, the only app using the CPU is VSCode. Everything goes back to normal when I manually restart the Extension Host Manager. I’m pretty sure it’s related to Copilot because this happens repeatedly after the first prompt.

I reinstalled VSC and cleaned his cache in the APP\_DATA folder. I also recently changed my CPU and motherboard, but the issue persists.

Really have a pain to use VS Code, switch to Nvim to investigate the codebase and back to VS - but Cursor work too good for my coding needs and improves my workflow dramatically, i wasn't possible to build so huge updates on large projects and cover them with tests.

The worse experience been with Windsurf - totally unexpected for me as i'm a big fan of their Codeium free autocomplete extension and using it for years, it's very good! But the pricing model of Windsurf is far too greedy, they charge a credit for each message you send to Sonnet and it differs a lot from Cursor a lot, i just got scared how quick my 5 test credits were spent on Windsurf. Cursor eats your money far slower. 

So for now Cursor functionality and pricing is a winner combo for me, but as soon as Copilot will update extension bit more and get closer to Cursor - i'll switch for Copilot as i don't like the idea of limited credits, and 500 monthly limit wasn't enough for my needs.",2025-02-20 23:42:58,2,0,0.0,vscode,cyberloh,False,Reddit (r/vscode),https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/1ita366/why_do_people_switch_to_cursor/mdycao6/

thanks for every one that contributed to ending this nightmare.



I have been trying to sign in to GitHub from vscode for about two weeks now and to no avail

I believe I have tried everything, searched the web for similar issues but for the first time no one had a similar issue, I have tried every AI chat there is, Gpt, deep seek, even copilot on github's website but nothing.

the issue looks very simple which is why it has dumbfounded me so much.

here's how it goes: vscode says I have to sign in to github to use associated features like copilot or to save my code in a repository, but when I do a pop up appears on the bottom right that says signing in to github.

I have stared at this pop up for longer than I can admit.

eventually after a couple minutes it says I haven't finished configuring the authenticator extension or something and says it will try to sign in using a local host, another half an hour and after it fails, gives me a code to past on the website to sign in, I do that and it says your all set, returning to vs code reveals that I am indeed not all set. as it gives me an ""Error signing in to github"" ""try again"" in a smug way

at first I thought nothing of it and it wasn't a big deal until a couple of days ago when I lost a big chunk of a project I've been working on for my collage

I'm so frustrated with every thing about this as no one seems to relate and I feel like the only one with this issue

I saw a post on stackoverflow for someone with what he described to be a similar issue to mine but no one seemed to know why and no solution to the problem was posted

here's a bunch of things I tried to do but didn't work

1. I'm working from home so no firewall or vpn or anything similar to try and block the extension I think.
2. tried to manually sign in using github from the terminal by configuring my user name and email. still nothing.
3. cleared any previous credentials stored on the extension if there was any since it didn't work once. nope. not it.
4. uninstall and reinstall, multiple times, nah.
5. use the token, most AI bots suggested, I don't have two factor authentication but still tried it, nothing.
6. made sure I was signed in to github on my browser before trying any of these by the way,
7. reinstall vs code because why not, god damnit.
8. check developer tools console for any warnings or errors for the network, you guessed it.

I would give my hand and or leg for any clue about this as it no longer is about saving my code from withering away due to power outages but is now about my dignity and self respect as a junior developer.

1ix2xm9,vscode-vim-mode: A Gentle Path to Vim Bliss in VS Code,">***TL;DR***

>\- This is a plugin promotion. Feel free to skip if you're not interested. I developed this tool to address specific workflow needs and hope it benefits others too.

>\- Transforms VS Code into a GVim  by running Vim within its integrated terminal

>\- Preserves editing states between sessions, sync file save actions between VSCode and Vim/Neovim

>\- Only suitable for hardcore Vim users, you need to have a meticulously configured Vim environment already in place

>\- Untested on Windows, it should work with WSL

🌟 **Hello Vim Enthusiasts!** 🌟

As a fellow Vim lover, I’ve built **vscode-vim-mode** to gently bridge Vim’s efficiency with VS Code’s modern features. If you’re curious about blending these worlds, I’d be honored if you gave it a try.

👉 **What it offers**:

* **Lightweight Vim/Neovim integration** without disrupting your VS Code workflow (Copilot, extensions, etc).
* **Peaceful coexistence**: Runs alongside plugins like VSCodeVim or VSCodeNeovim.
* **Simple toggle**: Switch modes with a button or command—no complexity.
* **Optional save sync**: For Neovim users, quietly trigger formatting on save.

This is a small attempt to serve the Vim community. If it makes even one coder’s day smoother, I’ll consider it worthwhile.

📦 **If you’d like to explore**:

* [Install via VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wy-z.vscode-vim-mode)
* [View or contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/wy-z/vscode-vim-mode)

**Thank you** for your time—and if you run into any issues or have suggestions, please feel free to reach out. Your feedback would mean a lot!

*Happy coding, and may your keystrokes stay efficient!* 🚀

1ikpk06,Multi-files coding AI tool,"Hi guys, I am new to coding and far from defining myself a programmer (just having fun). I have been using Github Copilot (Sonnet 3.5) on the website, which gives me the opportunity to refer to the repo, but it keeps giving me wrong import paths, and seems not to follow the project structure at all. 
So I also tried the Copilot edits feature on VSCode itself, with @codebase, and keep having similar issues. Do you have any suggestions? 
Ideally I am looking for a AI tool that does a great job at following the project structure (import modules paths etc.) and coordinating with all involved files. I am building a trading bot using questdb as database and Vite for the frontend.

mbpmzyi,,"Cline is better at coding in multiple files than Copilot is. Most alternatives are not really able to combine multiple queries and file edits into a single prompt or question. Not that I've seen anyways.

I haven't found the ideal AI companion for VSCode. They all have some massive downsides. And most AI still use the same model under the hood (Sonnet is often picked as default). So its mostly about how much they can do and what it costs. I've also noticed that while Cline is fine, you pay for the model separately and then it doesn't really have an unlimited one (that I can see, unless there's other options I have not yet seen). Overall I find copilot to not be fast enough for inline suggestions and autocomplete. Supermaven was much better in that but didn't allow me to include files into the chat (it should but it just didn't work for me). I've tried tabnine now and its fine but not always as great. Especially when you ask it to do something, it comes with a suggestion and just keeps circling back to that suggestion (and outdated coded after a few edits) when you want other options. Copilot also seems to do it.

I'm still open to trying other ones because I still think there's better ones out there but I just haven't found one that works for my set of libraries and languages (I'm an Angular dev that likes to use the latest stuff and uses Vitest+Spectator and Playwright currently and AI just sometimes sucks at using those).

In short it has easily EASILY doubled my throughput as a developer.

For my team it's allowed our junior devs to follow our conventions and documentation standards without even knowing it. It has fast paced their growth dramatically as well.

The key is providing really good context like any other LLM. So when having it generate bodies of code include good look alike files or blocks of code in your prompt. When doing inline code you can short cut this by giving several lines of comments above where you want the generation to happen giving extra context

mcqitjr,,"I've had copilot do some fairly trivial things that were useful. Most of it is things that were fairly easily predictable. I work primarily in C#. So for example if I'm creating an instance of a data model class like

    var asd = new Something()
    {
        A = something.A,
        B = something.B,
        etc
    }

Then it's ok at figuring out where I'm going with it, most of the time, and finishing it. That being said, when I do anything even a bit more complicated it's basically useless. When I try to use it in a large C++ project I work on, where some of the files have 20k+ LoC, and there's hundreds of files with hundreds of classes/structs, it's basically useless. In fact, it's less than useless, it's actively detrimental and constantly gets in the way.

Something like copilot could be great if these tools could fine tune based on our code base or something. And then actually give useful suggestions with a larger context window.

mcs0hbw,,"Yes, from the autocomplete, or I'd have turned it off entirely. I *do* turn it off entirely for personal projects, and I'm not even a little bit interested in the chat or ""agent"" part, but the autocomplete is *sometimes* useful:

First, it can help when traditional Intellisense stuff is broken. We have a large Python codebase, and standard VSCode Python tools want to crawl the entire workspace and load all of the types into memory for some reason. Sometimes it'll crawl enough of it to start doing useful things for me (while using multiple cores and basically all RAM it can get its hands on). But when that's not working, very small *code* completions from Copilot can be helpful.

Second, it seems to be good enough at boilerplate to be more useful than just copy/paste. IMO this is not a massive deal, because if you have so much boilerplate that you need an LLM to deal with it, you should instead get rid of that boilerplate. But an exception is test code, which is intentionally more repetitive and explicit. And I have occasionally had the experience of typing literally just the name of the test I want, like

    def test_do_thing_X_with_Y_disabled():

or whatever detailed name... and it fills in the entire body of the test, adapted for my actual test method, and gets it right the first time. I suspect this is where we get the ""replace a junior"" ideas -- it doesn't replace the *best* things juniors can do, but it can do some of the shit work you'd otherwise ask a junior to do.

I've occasionally had it generate longer chunks that were kind of okay starting points, but where I ended up replacing maybe 80% of what it generated. Pretty sure this is where MS gets their bullshit ""50% improvement"" numbers from, if they're counting the amount of generated suggestions that people hit tab to accept, and not the number that actually get *used.* And also, the longer the generated snippet, the more likely it is to get it wrong, so there's no way I'm excited about the whole ""agent mode"" idea of prompting it to make sweeping refactors to multiple files. The idea of assigning a Jira task to it and expecting it to complete it on its own seems like an absolute pipe dream.

---

Anyway, this is why I find the cursing hack to be useful: Originally, there was some significant latency that it'd need to pop up a suggestion, but they've optimized that, so when it's confident it has the right answer, it's like it has a suggestion every other keystroke. And it is extremely overconfident about generating text. I haven't been able to adapt the part of my brain that'll automatically read anything that pops up next to my cursor, so if I'm trying to type a comment, it will *constantly* interrupt my train of thought with its own inane ways to finish that sentence.

You ever meet a human who just has to fill every possible bit of silence, so if you pause to take a breath they'll try to finish your sentence? And sometimes you have to just stop and address it, like ""This will take *longer* if you don't have the patience to let me finish a sentence on my own""? That's what this is like.

So even in a codebase where it's finding ways to be kinda useful generating code, I'll still curse at it to turn it off when I'm trying to write a comment.",2025-02-14 11:07:41,2,0,0.0,programming,SanityInAnarchy,False,Reddit (r/programming),https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ip6dts/heres_what_devs_are_saying_about_new_github/mcs0hbw/
mcriqcw,,"It's not *typing*, no.

But the fact is that Copilot saves a huge amount of time in terms of facilitating the lookup and debugging of features by just filling in the appropriate code; and while yes, it needs debugging and no, it won't get it right every time, it's still going to improve the output of six coders such that you can probably get the same amount of tickets completed with four coders with Copilot than you could with six without.

I see what you're saying, but I'm not so sure that's true.

At the very least, there's a point at which administrators would rather have more money than more features.  It's just sexier to tell the board you've doubled profits than that you've doubled sprint velocity.

Microsoft, Apple and Google are also notably companies with basically a limitless agenda, also.  Most companies I've worked for would eventually run out of stuff to do; and also you might want to rein in the adulation of Meta - they're notably firing programmers to ""lean out their operation"".

My own biggest problem with AI has nothing to do with Copilot though; it's more that fucking AI application programs are spamming hiring companies with submissions that the applicant probably hasn't even read, meaning it's bloody impossible to find a contract at the moment.

mffmagh,,"I've met a lot of those teachers - they seem to think that programming (any kind of programming, be it HTML, XML, CSS, JSON, or Java, C, Python, JavaScript) is about learning keywords and syntax, and automagically being able to organize and structure code while learning the semantics and logic at the same time.

I used to have the same idea, until I noticed that what students learning with notepad was struggling with, was syntax, forgetting semicolons or brackets, or closing tags, where as what students learning with actual modern editors was struggling with, was understanding how to most effectively solve the problems given in the assignments.

What finally convinced me of the stupidity of the ""better learn it the simple way first"" was when I had a class that was taught with all the fancy plugins, getting rainbow-colored bracket-matching, automatic indentation, automatic tag-closing, automatic formatting and automatic highlighting of compile and validation errors, as well as syntax highlighting. After their first semester another class started with one of the notepad-teachers, and some of the students that had been learning with all the modern tools were employed as teaching assistants. They could easily spot errors in syntax (indentation, missing closing etc.) in the notepad-students' work, and help them fix it - even though they didn't have all the fancy tools at their disposal. And they soon realized that these poor students weren't learning programming, but were learning how to structure and format code correctly - and the new students never reached the same level as the ones with the fancy tools.

The only tool I'm still not too thrilled about is the fully automatic line-completion in JetBrains editors - as well as of course using CoPilot or other tools to actually write the code. But anything that can help you structure the code and avoid writing syntax errors - I'd recommend it.

But of course the notepad teachers are still going strong - and every improvement to new editors is used as an argument against teaching the students to use those tools.

They DO help with learning to program - and then you can always write code (and pseudocode) on paper when you have learned how to program!",2025-03-01 06:17:54,52,0,0.0,learnprogramming,peterlinddk,False,Reddit (r/learnprogramming),https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j0z67j/html_teacher_wants_us_to_use_notepad_instead_of/mffmagh/
mffrnk3,,"As someone who's taught coders before, I think there's some validity to the ""struggle"" idea, but largely disagree with it.

One actually valid concern for new programmers is that there's a very fine line between tools making your life easier and more difficult, and the more IDE you start with at the beginning, the more you tend to live in the ""difficult"" space. Complex tools have complex usage and configuration patterns, and you don't want to spend all your time just making your environment work.

I do agree about avoiding AI, but there are lots of other tools like interactive syntax highlighting and autocompletion that have been around for decades, and do reduce your cognitive load by A LOT. Plus some of the handy plugins for doing quick builds or loads or whatnot, those can be huge frustration avoiders.

I'm a little out of the loop since I don't code for a day job anymore. Is Copilot automatically integrated and if so can you avoid it by removing plugins or using VSCodium or things like that?

It reminds me of my first web paper. I had an undergraduate coding frontend and c#/.net


I produced my assignment by hand coding the html as we all do, and the teacher thought to mock me in front of the class for not using the Dreamweaver wysiwyg (which there was no requirement to do)


But this point I'd produced several landing pages and a couple of non-trivial tech projects at work.


So I explained to the teacher that I was already employed for over a year and doing this is a real world setting, that no one is using Dreamweaver professionally, that the senior team I brought my assignments to were laughing at them.


After class I was asked to stay behind, HE wanted to lecture me about embarrassing him. I showed him my job offer, salary and a couple of projects. then went to faculty management explaining what had happened.


To cut this off short, he was replaced immediately, and I got full credit for the paper using a work project that was already complete.

1j1m6v6,Is GitHub Copilot a better learning tool than Googling for coding help as a beginner?,"I’ve been thinking about whether using GitHub Copilot (or similar AI tools) is actually faster and maybe even better than the traditional way of Googling for coding help.

As a total beginner, when I Google a simple coding problem, I often end up overwhelmed by Stack Overflow threads, documentation, and discussions about frameworks and concepts that are way above my level. It turns into a loop where I have to Google every little thing just to understand the explanation, making the process slow and frustrating.

With Copilot, on the other hand, I feel like I get responses more tailored to my level—as long as I provide the right input. If I then take the time to really understand why Copilot generated a specific solution (not just blindly copying the code), wouldn’t that be a more effective way to learn than constantly searching through complex explanations?

1j3ydlo,Will Following This Frontend Roadmap Make Me an Intermediate Developer? Seeking Advice!,"Hey everyone,

I'm at the very beginning of my journey into frontend development, and I’ve created a structured learning approach for myself. I found [roadmap.sh/frontend](https://roadmap.sh/frontend), and I’m following it **step by step**, watching every single video and learning everything listed there.

My goal is to **change my life and get into programming seriously**. I already have some experience with C++, C#, and Java, but now I’ve started with **HTML basics** and I’m currently learning **CSS fundamentals**.

My question is: **Once I complete everything on this roadmap, will I be considered an intermediate frontend developer?** Also, what exactly defines the difference between **junior, intermediate, and senior developers** in real-world experience?

Another concern I have is **AI and the future of programming**. I’m using GitHub Copilot, and it feels like it does a lot of the work for me. Do I really need to go through all of this learning when AI is advancing so quickly? Is frontend development still a good field to get into, or should I reconsider my path?

mg6kmdk,,"Following that roadmap will not make you an intermediate developer. It *might* get you to junior level, depending on how diligent you are.

Assume 2000-4000 hours worth of study and practice to get to maybe being hirable as a junior, and 5000 hours worth of professional experience after that to be intermediate. Expect to take 4-5 years to become hirable as a junior (that's about how long a B.Sc. in CS will take you, plus maybe an internship), and another 3-5 years of working full time as a programmer beyond that to hit intermediate.

>I’m using GitHub Copilot, and it feels like it does a lot of the work for me. Do I really need to go through all of this learning when AI is advancing so quickly?

So, a lot of people talk about AI eliminating junior roles and I don't know how true that actually is or not. But it definitely won't eliminate more senior roles who'll be needed to fix all the mistakes the AI makes. So you need developers who are *significantly more skilled and knowledgeable* than the AI is - if you can't do everything the AI does with trivial effort on your part, how can you then go an know more than the AI does?

1j5bf4o,Looking for resources to practice practical coding interview style questions,"I've been laid off for awhile now and been in the industry for 5 years. Been doing leetcode and studying system design, polishing my resume/CLs and all other behavioural questions I can think of.

So far I always ace the initial leetcode interviews, system design questions and behavioural questions, but the moment I hit practical questions, my brain shuts off and and works at a snails pace. I've gotten really good at communicating my thoughts with the design for how to solve the problem, but coding the solution is very slow for me, where I backtrack to use better data structures. It doesn't come easy, and I only seem to know what to do as I code, and by the time I have a better idea of how to code it's too late, it's the end of the interview, and the interviewer is looking at me like I'm a fraud.

Just looking to see where I can find more practical interview questions for me to practice. Copilot is unable to generate these for me, it just generates the same ones or points me towards leetcode questions.

Please drop down any resources below, I'd really appreciate it. Been out of a job for more than half a year now and my wallet is not too happy :'(

Here's an example of one of these practical interview questions I got from a very recent interview, in case I'm using the wrong term:

Ways in which this affects me:
- Writing design docs bores me. I would rather prototype and learn as I do. Though I do see benefit of designing to ensure requirements are clear, evaluate trade-offs, and prevent wasted efforts / inefficient solutions. I see the benefit. I just don’t enjoy writing them as much. I like to do. 
- It’s difficult for me to estimate the ETA of a task. I’d rather just work on two important tasks in parallel and try to finish both as quickly as possible. When I am blocked on one, I work on the other. 
- And I’m worried that Cursor/Copilot AI is going to automate me, and I don’t really have any career plan here when that happens.

1inmmaq,"Best solution for checking Javascript typos quickly, NOT tied to Visual Studio?","Hello, all. Yes, I've been reading the FAQ and tools pages.

I use Javascript for RPG Maker scripts, so nothing overly complex or heavy. Normally, I use Notepad++ to actually write my code, as it's lightweight and fast, and has syntax coloring. However, if I ever have a typo, I can't exactly jump to it in N++. I have several plugins from the Plugins Admin window related to JS and JSON, but none of them seem to offer syntactical or typographic checkers.

To check typos, I was using VSCode, but MS is starting to push Copilot more and more as a base feature. I don't want to use Copilot and I don't want AI features I can't disable--- MS, after all, is well-known for forcing stupid shit on users after updates. I know that vscodium is an open-source fork of Visual Studio, but if Copilot is integrated more deeply into VS in the future, then vscodium could potentially be unable to remove it without fucking things up. Since vscodium is open-source, this is not as likely as a closed system, but I'd still rather become independent from the VS ecosystem now as opposed to later.

I would like to run through the options presented on the tools page and discuss how I have weighed each of them. I will ignore the IDE section as none of them are tailored to JS, so we can only discuss the editors.

VSCode: no

Sublime Text: Looked great! But it's paid, and I'm poor.

Atom: No longer available.

N++: If there is a plugin to identify and jump to typos in JS code, I'd love a recommendation.

TextMate: no Mac machine

Brackets: I've used this when I took web design courses at university, and rather enjoyed doing so. It seems to have been succeeded by Phoenix Code. PHCode has JSHint for browser-based checking, but I use Firefox, so I can't open local files on the web editor. Otherwise, you have to use ESLint, but I'm not even sure if I can make ESLint a dependency of my RPG Maker project, and even if I could, setting it up looks confusing. (I'm really bad at CLI stuff and it seems like every time I try it something breaks that shouldn't...)

gedit: Paid for MS.

Komodo Edit/IDE: I can't tell if the free tier supports JS or not.

I’m a mid-level full-stack engineer with **3 years of experience**, mainly working with **React, Node.js, and AWS**, and I’m currently looking for my next role in **London**. The interview process has been a bit of a rollercoaster—every company seems to have a completely different approach, and I’m struggling to figure out how to prepare efficiently.

So far, I’ve come across:

* **LeetCode-style DS&A questions** (fairly standard, but still hit-or-miss on difficulty)
* **Verbal technical deep dives** (these range from broad discussions to very specific knowledge checks)
* **Pair programming sessions** (this is where I feel the least prepared)

I find that because the formats vary so much, I don’t know where to focus my time. Has anyone else dealt with this? What’s the best way to prep, especially for **pair programming**? I also find it harder and more daunting because I feel like I’ve become reliant on Copilot, and writing code from my own head seems much harder now.

mgkujqk,,"IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate for me. Yes, it's expensive, but this is my profession, not my hobby. I would do DIY work around the house with tools from Walmart or Harbor Freight but if I'm framing, I'm rolling with Metabo (or something equally high quality).

I currently use Copilot because Cursor feels like it tries to replace too much of how I actually USE my IDE in the first place. Not to toot my own horn but hey, I've been coding since I was 14 and I'm 49. Imagine knowing a foreign language for almost 40 years. You may not be the best in the world at it but you've still outgrown tools like Duolingo.

I don't ""chat"" with Copilot and ask it to write a function for me. It's not even about the code it generates. It just honestly takes me longer to write the prompts in the precise way needed to get the function done the way I would have just written it myself. I work mostly on business-oriented Web and mobile apps, and usually when their logic gets complex it's because there are more rules, not because you're trying to come up with a yet-more-optimal ed25519 curve generator. Time sheets can't be submitted if they don't have start and end times. Oh, also, they can't be submitted if the job code is inactive. Oh, and don't forget, end time must be > start time. Oh and a shift can't be >20h without human approval. Oh yeah, check to be sure it's not a holiday. You get the idea. Just listing all that in a chat session as precisely as you need to do to get the code to be correct - I could have just written it in a few minutes. I didn't need help with that.

The reason I use it at all is because of REFACTORING. Man, Copilot is insanely useful when it comes to that. Pivoting some nested object of consts into an array to feed something like a form-fields-defaults dropdown... I'll get some spreadsheet from Product, paste it into a comment, then just start typing the first entry of the array in the shape I want them all to be. By the time I'm on the second or third, it's figured out what I'm doing and I can just code-complete to get the rest. A small amount of editing, and a tedious task is now just a TAB key to accept it and done. And there are no prompts to adjust it either. If I don't like what it's suggesting, I just keep adjusting my first few entries and eventually it figures out the right pattern.",2025-03-07 13:23:06,14,0,0.0,webdev,CodeAndBiscuits,False,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1j5z69o/which_ide_do_you_use/mgkujqk/

I'm looking for something to plug into Intellij PHPStorm where I would be able to talk to it like I do with ChatGPT to suggest changes to the currently open project. But I need it to take into account the entire open project, not just the current file, and also to create new folders/files if needed.

So far I've tried (these are subjective):

\* Github Copilot - autocomplete on steroids, only sees the currently open file

\* ChatGPT/Claude/Deepseek web ui - only knows what you tell it

\* Supermaven - like Copilot, but faster I guess

\* cursor - it's pretty much a ChatGPT wrapper in an app. For example, it's asking me questions like \`What framework/technology are you using? (React, Vue, plain HTML, etc.)\` when it has the entire project open and it should be able to know everything about it

\* replit - this is the closest one to the one that I'm looking for, but I couldn't get my project to run in the webview and while I love how it creates new files when appropriate, I would still prefer to have it in my IDE

1it3dhk,[Partially Rant] I truly want to use AI but..,"Hello everyone. I'm actually using ChatGPT and Copilot to help me in my daily job. Since now I just used those to help me write basic functions as some sort of personal assistant. Stuff like ""provide a function that sorts my array of objects given that specific logic"" or ""provide a boilerplate for that framework using that other framework"". This because I never managed to get something more usefull from an LLM. 

Cause people keep saying I'm the one who uses them bad I've spent the last 4 months trying to leverage LLM power to a further level...failing miserably. 

As a test project I'm now trying to convert a 3d engine I've already wrote in C++ to a webgl2 engine using typescript. I decided to use ChatGPT o1 and o3 since the beginning of the project hoping that the LLM could keep its own context updated by not needing to interpret some already existing sources. ChatGPT was able to provide a typescript project with the Hello World of 3d programming:  a working WebGL2  example with a static triangle. Nice! 

  
At this point problems arise.  As the project grew and modularity kicked in ChatGPT started allucinating badly. As every decent 3d engine works I split my Classes into modules. So now I have a Renderer class, a Scene class, a Mesh class, some Utility classes like CompileShaders, LoadTextures and so on. 

  
No matter how hard I try and how frequently I reupload my sources, ChatGPT keeps ""forgetting"" stuff he has provided and keeps writing (buggy) new code as the previous work never existed. I need a new shader? ChatGPT keeps writing private functions to load and compile shaders, even if I just reminded it he already provided a Utility class that specifically does that.  A texture? Let's rewrite the texture loading code instead of using the already existing one that ChatGPT itself provided. 

And BLODY HELL, I hate when it does an error and I need to keep telling it to not include that error. ""Hey that part is wrong, you should do it that way"" ""Ok"" And then, after one step, it keeps doing the same error I told it not to do.

I tried updating the context by explaining stuff, by re-uploading to ChatGPT the current sources, using single files, using an archive of the whole folder. Nothing works. It seems it can ""remember"" stuff it did for 1 or 2 steps then it restarts from scratch.

is it me? Is it the model I'm using? Is it a context capacity issue? Are we still far from a truly usable LLM to do real world stuff other than ""write me this simple code I can write by myself but I'm too lazy to type""?",2025-02-19 03:31:34,0,21,0.43,webdev,rio_sk,True,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1it3dhk/partially_rant_i_truly_want_to_use_ai_but/
mdmhmyj,,"In the current state of LLM using them efficiently to tackle real coding uses is a skill, let's be honest most people that coded before the LLM era suck big time at it, like big BIG time, even better they don't want to learn, they expect LLM to meet them in their comfort zone.

Learning to Google is a skill, if you can't do it, it's quite obvious to someone that knows how to do it. It's a skill because knowing the boundaries and hitting the right spot at the boundary is what makes you good at it, people that can't do that have a very hard time finding whatever they are looking for with Google. You don't randomly type your whole codebase on google and expect a solution to appear ...

I've been using things that existed before Copilot and GPT3.0 (those were BAD) and I mastered the use of the tool, each new updates I could appreciate the new capabilities and could see boundaries expanding.

LLM are limited, forget stuff, make mistakes, hallucinate stuffs etc... each one of them have their own strength and limits, currently they are weak enough that it's not only noticeable but differences between models and providers are also clearly noticeable.

I've been coding for about 20 years, and I took me a bit of time to fully embrace the new meta but once I started to master it, it's became easier than Googling stuffs, it's 100x more powerful than any other tool we had in the past, be it builtin docs or search engines/ SO etc...

Everytime I see a senior dev trying to use a LLM, he looks like a child about to hit his head on a table that he isn't seeing, it's obvious before he even start writing his message that it's not going to work the whole premise and the way he's approaching the problem is incorrect, he then writes something that makes it even more obvious that he doesn't understand what he's doing, the expected failure inevitably comes.",2025-02-19 07:09:34,1,0,0.0,webdev,SaltMaker23,False,Reddit (r/webdev),https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1it3dhk/partially_rant_i_truly_want_to_use_ai_but/mdmhmyj/

1ini225,AI Usage in IDE's,"I'm sure this has been beaten to death, but let's give it another go.

I use several IDE's and one thing they all share is a thriving AI ecosystem. From JetBrains to VSCode the drive to AI is hard to ignore. That  VSCode-->Copilot-->GitHub workflow is really something and keeps getting better.

Codeium, Cursor and such only make it easier and as open source models emerge and costs come down it's only going to get more common.

Being able to say, ""Using DDEV, create a directory, make a database and clone this repo into it then run the install script "" and have it all work is freakin' magic. Telling my editor to make a change, say to rename something, throughout my entire codebase is trivial and I can say it in plain English. Most of the time it's just fancy find&replace, but it's almost always better formatted and commented than I would do alone. I don't even have to mess with Prettier and linters.

I can feed this thing specific docs. I'm not a smart man, there are many docs that I find impenetrable and many more that I constantly Google. Relating those docs to the codebase that I'm working in purely amazing -- I can find out anything. Right where I actually need it.

Sure, sometimes it goes horribly wrong, but this is why it's in IDE's to start with. A baseline knowledge is assumed -- .cursorrules and context are not trivial if you want them to work. Prompt engineering isn't hard, just describe what you want, but it also isn't idiot proof and if you don't understand the code and can't use the editor without AI you are done. Over. Rover.

I just find the messaging around these tools to be a little bizarre. There is almost a late night infomercial vibe to it all. 

“Throw all your knives away! You only need this one!”

I saw a post by someone who works at a VP level raving over a demo where someone cloned an app using some AI tool. He then trash talked the “old school” way of building software with scrum teams and dozens of devs.

It was very disappointing, and alarming to see a post like that, because I feel he should know better. Imagine working as a welder, and your boss walks in and says, “I saw a commercial where this guy put an entire boat together using this stuff called Flex Seal. All he had to do was spray it on. I want all this old school welding equipment out of here.”

1iq9ueh,Interesting results from asking what Gemini and Copilot think of each other.,"Interestingly Gemini gives a more detailed answer:

  
**Asking Gemini**

what do you think about microsoft copilot

Microsoft Copilot is a powerful AI tool that has the potential to revolutionize how we work and interact with technology. It's still relatively new, but it's showing a lot of promise. Here's a breakdown of what I think about it:

**What I like:**

* **Integration with Microsoft 365:** Copilot's tight integration with Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook is a game-changer. It can help you write documents, create presentations, analyze data, and manage emails more efficiently.
* **Productivity boost:** Copilot can automate repetitive tasks, suggest relevant content, and provide quick answers to your questions, saving you time and effort.
* **Creative assistance:** It can help you brainstorm ideas, generate creative content, and overcome writer's block.
* **Accessibility:** Copilot can make technology more accessible to people with disabilities by providing alternative ways to interact with computers.

**What could be improved:**

* **Accuracy:** Like any AI model, Copilot can sometimes make mistakes or provide inaccurate information. It's important to double-check its output and use your own judgment.
* **Privacy concerns:** Using AI tools that have access to your data raises privacy concerns. Microsoft needs to be transparent about how it uses your data and ensure that it's protected.
* **Bias:** AI models can inherit biases from the data they're trained on. It's important to be aware of these biases and work towards making Copilot more inclusive and equitable.
* **Cost:** Copilot is a paid service, which may be a barrier for some users.

**Overall:**

Microsoft Copilot is a promising tool with the potential to significantly improve productivity and creativity. It's not perfect, but it's constantly evolving and improving.

what do you think of google gemini?

Google Gemini is poised to be a significant leap forward in the world of artificial intelligence. Developed by Google DeepMind, it's expected to be a multimodal AI system, meaning it can process and generate content across different types of data like text, images, and perhaps even audio and video. This integration could allow for more sophisticated understanding and interaction, blurring the lines between different forms of information.

What's exciting about Gemini is its potential to handle complex tasks that current models might struggle with. For instance, it could read a piece of text, analyze an accompanying image, and provide insights that consider both sources simultaneously. This could revolutionize fields like education, where interactive and adaptive learning experiences become more immersive, or in creative industries, where AI could assist in generating rich multimedia content.

However, it's also important to consider the ethical implications. As AI systems become more advanced, questions around data privacy, security, and the potential for misuse become even more critical. Ensuring that technologies like Gemini are developed and implemented responsibly will be key to harnessing their benefits without unintended consequences.

It's fascinating to think about how Gemini might influence everyday life. Imagine virtual assistants that not only understand your words but also interpret visual cues to provide more personalized assistance. Or consider advancements in healthcare diagnostics, where AI could analyze medical images and patient data to support doctors in making more accurate diagnoses.

Have you thought about how an AI like Gemini could impact areas you're interested in or passionate about? The possibilities are vast, and it's an exciting time to consider the future of human-AI collaboration.",2025-02-15 11:59:24,1,1,0.57,artificial,Deafcon2018,True,Reddit (r/artificial),https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iq9ueh/interesting_results_from_asking_what_gemini_and/

1ixb7rk,Claude Code: The Future of Agentic Coding?,"Claude 3.7 Sonnet just launched, but Claude Code might be the real game-changer for devs.

A command-line tool that lets you delegate engineering tasks to Claude directly from the terminal. Early testers (Vercel, Replit) say it’s handling full-stack updates & web apps like a pro.

Could this rival Copilot X and Cursor's integrated AI pair-programming? Or will it be limited by Claude's API constraints?

Any devs here got access to the research preview? Would love to hear your thoughts!

mfbofgz,,"What you actually tested was Claude (with SVG), DALL-E 3, Imagen 3, DALL-E 3 again, and Flux Pro. None of these models generate their own images. 4o and Gemini 2 are capable internally, but this isn't released to the public for some reason. Copilot is ChatGPT, ChatGPT uses DALL-E 3, so you tested that twice.

Edit: Although, the reason Copilot's looks different is they likely nuked the word ""Pixar"" from your prompt before sending it.
