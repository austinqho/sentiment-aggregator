Caveat: likely not work for anyone else - Sorry

I had this happen to me today, the write\_file tool worked fine, but the edit\_file tool failed everytime.  
The error is consistent: ""incomplete envelope"" from [192.34.20.166:443](http://192.34.20.166:443)

If I made a new file, no issue, and I could then move it around, but this also BURNED down my flow credits.

They showed up as ReparsePoint in my filesystem:

    Name                    LastWriteTime                  Attributes

    interface.py            12-03-2025 13:27:09 Archive, ReparsePoint

Solution for me was to not have the files live in a dropbox folder, and move them to a ""simple"" folder.

I got it all moved over the a simple folder, and then it worked fine for me immediately.

Wanted to set up a automated self-hosted Gitlab in WSL, but then I ran out of flow credits and now I am seriously thinking I should just do it manually like a common coder :D

I was to be honest leaning on Windsurf to do things that I could just as easily do myself, so I guess it is fair I lost all of my credits.

But I am certain that my mind will have forgotten all of this by the time my credits roll around.

1jbhgqd,Windsurf Exit Code 130,"Does anyone know how to fix Windsurf exit code 130 error when it is trying to run commands on mac?

It used to work then I stopped using Windsurf for a month and now I need it again and it doesn't run commands anymore. i don't know if i changed something on my mac to cause it.

    $ $ cat /Users/_______/Development/_______/.git/config

Exit Code 130Not auto-runThought Process

I'm getting exit code 130 when trying to run commands, which typically indicates the command was terminated with SIGINT (Ctrl+C). Let me try a simpler approach with less invasive commands to understand the issue.

I notice there's an issue running some of the commands. Let me try a different approach to help diagnose your git remote issue.

Ran terminal command

    ~/Development/________

Go to terminal

    $ pwd

Exit Code 130

I can see the commands are actually running in the terminal when I view it there, just it gets INT x

─    \~/Development/\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_    master ──────────────────────────────────────────────────── INT ✘  07:49:33 PM  ─╮

So it is able to run the command and display the output of the command in the terminal but then it gets this INT error and everytime Cascade says it got Exit Code 130 instead of doing productive tasks.

note that just opening a wsl terminal and typing `windsurf .` won't work, at least for me (it opens the folder but doesn't connect to remote).

There’s been a lot of talk recently about how Windsurf’s context retrieval is better than other products. One rebuttal I’ve seen is that all products “index your codebase”.

But indexing code ≠ context retrieval. It is necessary but not sufficient.

Thought I’d share a bit about what we’re doing under the hood to get the best results.

Indexing & embedding search is a tablestakes RAG technique. Btw, even for this technique there are approaches that make this more or less effective. One thing we are doing is AST parsing code and chunking along semantically meaningful boundaries - not random blocks of code. This means that when a code chunk is retrieved, it is a full function or class, not just an arbitrary block of consecutive code.

But embedding search becomes unreliable as a retrieval heuristic as the size of the codebase grows. Instead, we must rely on a combination of techniques like grep/file search, knowledge graph based retrieval, and more. With all these heuristics, a re-ranking step also becomes needed where the retrieved context is ranked in order of relevance. We use LLM based reranking under the hood.

“Varun did you just give away your secret sauce??”

No. This is all known. The reason other products don’t do this is simple: latency. This multidimensional retrieval takes a lot of compute and thus time. The reason Windsurf can do it is because we have spent years investing in building the best GPU infrastructure. After all, we literally started off as a GPU workload optimization company called Exafunction…so we know a thing or two about this 🙂

Hopefully this helps clear the air and explain why those who are testing us side-by-side with other products on small test codebases are getting comparable results.

1j8pivq,Sonnet 3.7 really impressed me for starting a project from scratch,"I shared my experience how I got frustrated from using sonnet 3.7 in my existing project. It costs lots of flow credits but didn't deliver ideal result. But given it is so relentlessly reviewed multiple files back and forth, I got the hope that it can do better at a blank project. So after developing the backend, I gave it a try with my flutter project. 

I tried to make the requirement as details as possible (though not as that detailed as when I was in the corp needing to pass the PRD to engineering team), and then I asked R1 to review the requirements and make a plan based on the requirement. Then I revised the plan a few times trying to reduce ambiguity.  I wasn't that greedy to make everything in the plan because I don't want to overload Sonnet and its buddies so I just got the onboarding module + shared components + core services + data models detailed in the requirement and plan. 

Then Sonnet 3.7 starts its working. It lasted about 30 mins, and more than 50 files were created. I saw it creating the files and then went through files to fix lint errors all over again, speaking of which I really appreciate Windsurf doesn't cost credits when fixing lint errors.

I started the simulator nervously but it successfully started and gave a workable app as I expected. There are still some small issues that I may need to fix later, but so far I was just amazed by what Sonnet 3.7 and Windsurf could do!

Then Sonnet 3.7 starts its working. It lasted about 30 mins, and more than 50 files were created. I saw it creating the files and then went through files to fix lint errors all over again, speaking of which I really appreciate Windsurf doesn't cost credits when fixing lint errors.

I started the simulator nervously but it successfully started and gave a workable app as I expected. There are still some small issues that I may need to fix later, but so far I was just amazed by what Sonnet 3.7 and Windsurf could do!

Thank you Codium team!","Sonnet 3.7 really impressed me for starting a project from scratch I shared my experience how I got frustrated from using sonnet 3.7 in my existing project. It costs lots of flow credits but didnt deliver ideal result. But given it is so relentlessly reviewed multiple files back and forth, I got the hope that it can do better at a blank project. So after developing the backend, I gave it a try with my flutter project. I tried to make the requirement as details as possible though not as that detailed as when I was in the corp needing to pass the PRD to engineering team, and then I asked R1 to review the requirements and make a plan based on the requirement.

The Windsurf team recently shipped an auto-fix-lint-errors thing. I assume this doesn't use the super-premium models, and instead routes to some other service. But they underestimated just how much load / credits / etc. would be taken by the lint-fixing loop.

I think their API load may have > doubled due to the lint fixing feature, and it's a kind of find-the-bottleneck-in-production type of devops issue.

  
This is also coupled with Claude 3.7 being optimized for evals, which favor smaller incremental edits - but this comes at the cost of tokens & usage etc.

I have put in a request for a real solution to my problem (storing auth with profiles), but until then, I am ok with switching windsurf users by re-logging-in to the web and then re-logging-in in the windsurf. However, this process takes  twice as long as it should because there isn't a handler for the `windsurf://` urls the editor tries to use to redirect back to the IDE.

I use Fedora, which windsurf doesn't have a sys package for, so I have to use the tarball. The tarball doesn't have a .desktop file so I had to create my own. I finally managed to get something working so the login now opens windsurf, but it opens a new window, not the window that initiated the login request. When i try to open an existing project or a new window, the auth is lost.

I have put in a request for a real solution to my problem (storing auth with profiles), but until then, I am ok with switching windsurf users by re-logging-in to the web and then re-logging-in in the windsurf. However, this process takes  twice as long as it should because there isn't a handler for the `windsurf://` urls the editor tries to use to redirect back to the IDE.

I use Fedora, which windsurf doesn't have a sys package for, so I have to use the tarball. The tarball doesn't have a .desktop file so I had to create my own. I finally managed to get something working so the login now opens windsurf, but it opens a new window, not the window that initiated the login request. When i try to open an existing project or a new window, the auth is lost.

1jbv6yw,Is there a way to disable Cascade memories?,"So Cascade Memories seems like a nice idea in theory, however in practice I've begun to find it really troublesome. 

For example, I've recently been working on a few Docker-based Dev Ops projects for deployments of various stacks onto servers and have been using Windsurf to expedite the tedious process of writing multiple Docker Compose files. On the surface, they look like very similar ""things"", but each one is a completely different project with very unique requirements.

One of the stacks (an AI stack) used Langflow. Comically, until it became hugely frustrating, Codeium decided that Langflow should be called ""LandGraph"" and botched the docker-compose and .env by referring to the wrong project. 

I thought that I had finally exorcised ""Landgraph"" from my life but alas, working on a completely different project a week later, Cascade has decided that my current (unrelated) project must be the same thing as I was working on a week ago. Apparently, a memory had been formed along the lines of ""the user uses Landgraph"".

Thus, while executing one of its flows, I noticed that Cascade had taken the executive decision that ""LandGraph"" needed to be added back to this project. Not for the first time, I found myself writing angrily in all caps to a bot: ""THERE IS NO LANDGRAPH. WTH ARE YOU DOING!?!?""

If I can be a little cheeky I suggest again to pay attention to what many users here seem to be saying: there's rough around the edges, but it seems like many of these features just haven't had basic QA-ing.

mgtz1q4,,"I can't help you much because you're working with things I don't know much about, but I understand how Windsurf works quite well, so I can help you on a couple of points: the .md documents are more useful to you than to Cascade. In the sense that you should make it read the documents every time, in every conversation, and if you do it with a premium model you will only consume credits for this. So, here's my example: I have my workspace ""Modulandia"", inside the workspace I have 3 folders: Modulandia, Context, Appunti.
Modulandia is the project folder, it contains the code, the build folder... Context is the folder with the .md files that I prepare for Cascade. Appunti is a folder with .txt files that are exclusively useful to me (for example, a list of commands for the terminal).


How I recommend you use the .md files:
write them, make Cascade Base read them only once and ask it to create a memory. This way you don't have to make him read them later (unless you need to update them... for example if you have Changelog.md and the corresponding saved memory Changelog, update your .md file, delete the saved memory, tell him to read the .md file and create a memory with that information. You can also ask him to just update the memory, but it doesn't always work well and sometimes duplicate memories, so I always prefer to delete the memory and recreate it updated, so having the .md files is useful for you to keep control over the situation, once you have saved Cascade's memories, the .md files become useless for him).


How to mention files for context: mention specific files, for example @Main.cpp, @MainWindow.cpp etc... mentioning the folder doesn't help much, all Cascade will do is look at what files are inside the mentioned folder, then it will have to read those files... So if you mention the files directly, you save time and he saves effort.


Mentioning the folder can be useful when you don't even know where to look for something, situations like: function X should be in one of the files in the @Core folder. then Cascade will look at the files in the folder, try to figure out which file is most likely to contain that functionality, and search until it finds it. but you can do the same thing without mentioning folders and Cascade will simply search the entire workspace.",2025-03-09 03:20:29,3,0,0.0,Codeium,[deleted],False,Reddit (r/Codeium),https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1j71p0a/how_to_properly_feed_multiple_api_docs_to_cascade/mgtz1q4/,"I can't help you much because you're working with things I don't know much about, but I understand how Windsurf works quite well, so I can help you on a couple of points: the .md documents are more useful to you than to Cascade.

This way you dont have to make him read them later unless you need to update them... for example if you have Changelog.md and the corresponding saved memory Changelog, update your .md file, delete the saved memory, tell him to read the .md file and create a memory with that information. You can also ask him to just update the memory, but it doesnt always work well and sometimes duplicate memories, so I always prefer to delete the memory and recreate it updated, so having the .md files is useful for you to keep control over the situation, once you have saved Cascades memories, the .md files become useless for him. How to mention files for context mention specific files, for example .cpp, .cpp etc... mentioning the folder doesnt help much, all Cascade will do is look at what files are inside the mentioned folder, then it will have to read those files... So if you mention the files directly, you save time and he saves effort. Mentioning the folder can be useful when you dont even know where to look for something, situations like function X should be in one of the files in the folder. then Cascade will look at the files in the folder, try to figure out which file is most likely to contain that functionality, and search until it finds it. but you can do the same thing without mentioning folders and Cascade will simply search the entire workspace.","{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': 0.9926}",0.9926,"{'polarity': 0.07999999999999999, 'subjectivity': 0.37160714285714286}",0.07999999999999999,0.37160714285714286,Positive,0.9926

What do you mean? I've heard that a well-formatted structured markdown is the best format in which to convey a lot of information in an LLM context. There are two alternatives to do this in Windsurf: 1) ask this person via @ web to follow a link and read the api documentation web page, but this doesn't work well, I've tested it many times OR 2) drop chunks of documentation as is directly into the prompt, but this doesn't sound or look right.

mhf5r5x,,"Full transparency I work at Cline, but wanted to share my perspective:

Checkpoints are very effective in Cline, especially after our recent 2.0 update, which significantly boosted speed and drastically reduced storage needs.

One key difference is that Cline is usage-based instead of subscription-based (i.e. Cline's not cutting corners on your inference). This means it actively seeks more relevant context from your codebase and engages with you directly, creating a more responsive, agentic experience. However, depending on your usage (especially with 3.7 Sonnet), costs might exceed a fixed monthly subscription like Cursor's $20/month. A solid cost-saving alternative is leveraging high-quality yet more affordable models from DeepSeek or Gemini.

Regarding MCP, Cline has some underrated capabilities here. There's an integrated marketplace allowing you to easily connect to hundreds of servers. Additionally, Cline excels in building MCP servers—I've even created a .clinerules protocol designed specifically to simplify building custom MCP servers (https://docs.cline.bot/mcp-servers/mcp-server-from-scratch).

1j71ou6,Local .md API docs knowledgebase. How to properly feed it to LLM?,"Hey I’m building a web app an API aggregator for a specific topic with a unified simple UI. Something like OpenRouter /chat page, but for a different topic. Different API providers have completely different sets of methods, some use their own Python libraries, others work via HTTP GET/POST. I want to encapsulate each API in a separate library (class?) so my app interacts with all APIs the same way and I can easily integrate new API providers.

To achieve this, I started collecting a directory of markdown API docs for each provider, so the LLM has direct access to the documentation.

1. Is this a good idea overall? Creating a local markdown knowledge base as the way to give LLM access to API docs?

2. How should I structure and store the .md docs to make it easier for the LLM to find what it needs? Is it better to split docs into smaller .md files (\~100 lines / 3,000 chars) OR keep everything in one API Provider = one large .md file (\~700 lines / 20,000 chars) with all methods structured under H1, H2, H3? What works best for LLM?

3. And the main question. How do I properly feed the docs into the context? Should I @ mention a specific file or the entire docs folder in the prompt? Should I add a @ mention for the whole /api-docs folder in rules file? Could MCP help with this somehow?

How to properly feed it to LLM? Hey I’m building a web app an API aggregator for a specific topic with a unified simple UI. Something like OpenRouter /chat page, but for a different topic. Different API providers have completely different sets of methods, some use their own Python libraries, others work via HTTP GET/POST. I want to encapsulate each API in a separate library (class?) so my app interacts with all APIs the same way and I can easily integrate new API providers.

To achieve this, I started collecting a directory of markdown API docs for each provider, so the LLM has direct access to the documentation.

mgyi37q,,"With gh copilot i just chuck the doc in the context as long as its below ~40k token. The context window is now big enough to do that. Cursor/windsurf you can’t, I think their context window is really small (~30k). 

4o on Copilot is 128k token. Sonnet is similar. So you still have ~50k token to chat and attach file before it start forgetting about the documentation, which is plenty, at least for me

Here how I do it:

I use this: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_reusable-prompt-files-experimental

So you can use a keyboard shortcut to search them and load them in context. I basically copy/paste the documentation in the prompt file. Seems to work fine up to around 40k token. You can check the size of your doc with https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer

If it’s too big, I chunk it in topic.

It actually work much better than Cursor Docs which only get access to a summary of the doc. You can confirm that it’s loaded by asking very specific question to copilot, works like charm for me.

Here a small trick: load the prompt (doc) on the first prompt, then once copilot answer it’s loaded in the context, remove the prompt and then load your files and ask your questions.",2025-03-09 19:17:58,1,0,0.0,ChatGPTCoding,debian3,False,Reddit (r/ChatGPTCoding),https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1j71ou6/local_md_api_docs_knowledgebase_how_to_properly/mgyi37q/,"With gh copilot i just chuck the doc in the context as long as its below ~40k token.

1jbtswp,Which AI tools/models do you use for which tasks?,"There are more AI tools out there than stars in the sky (at least it feels that way 😅). To be honest, I'm starting to lose track:

* Which one for **writing code**?
* Which one for **refactoring & debugging**?
* And do you run any **local models** to leverage your NPU? (Deepseek r1 eg)

So, **what's your approach?** Do you use **ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Windsurf – or do you have hidden gems?** Do you switch tools depending on the task, or do you have a **go-to setup**?
